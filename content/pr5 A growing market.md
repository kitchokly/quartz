![A screenshot from the Building a Second Brain Website. The headline reads "A proven method to organize your digital life and unlike your creative potential." The byline reads “Get the Second Brain Quickstart Guide to start building your Second Brain, increase your productivity, and lead a more fulfilling life with more ease and less stress.

 > Even though there is a lot of open knowledge-sharing that happens in these spaces, there is a burgeoning market of PKM software, books, courses, and experts-for-hire, each of them promising a solution to the apparently contemporary problem of “information overload.” Frequently, these strategies are marketed as ways of building a “second brain” to support your thinking. They often draw parallels between information networks and the brain’s structure, with some even suggesting that choosing the software to house one’s note-taking system is akin to selecting a “neural center” for future thinking ([Forte, 2022](References/Forte,%202022.md), 67).
