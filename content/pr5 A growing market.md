 > Even though there is a lot of open knowledge-sharing that happens in these spaces, there is a burgeoning market of PKM software, books, courses, and experts-for-hire, each of them promising a solution to the apparently contemporary problem of “information overload.” Frequently, these strategies are marketed as ways of building a “second brain” to support your thinking. They often draw parallels between information networks and the brain’s structure, with some even suggesting that choosing the software to house one’s note-taking system is akin to selecting a “neural center” for future thinking ([Forte, 2022](References/Forte,%202022.md), 67).
