 > Like any method, adopting a networked note-taking system isn’t a guarantee for socially just research. But it has helped me recognize the situated and reflexive role of writing in this research—not just in the final draft of an article, but in the notes we use to support the knowledges we produce. Recognizing this role of note-taking is one opportunity to put our values at the foundation of this work.
