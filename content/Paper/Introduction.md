Most researchers write notes every day. This banality positions note-taking as practice requiring little explanation: We read something, attend a lecture, or make a research observation, and then commit it to paper (digital or otherwise), storing it for retrieval at a later date (or not). As @MarinSturm2021 point out, note-taking is largely considered a mechanical process at best and boring and ineffective at worst. But to take note is to quite literally define what is considered notable, and, by extension, what is not ([Gimenez & Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20&%20Pinel,%202013.md)). These noted observations then become evidence for the claims we make. Notes may not be frequently discussed, but they are part of the very foundation of the institutional production knowledge. 

Bound up with my own frustration with note-taking as a graduate student in the overlapping space of social sciences and humanities, I use this paper to position [notes as critical to the construction of academic knowledge](Paper/Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) and thus one useful space for feminist methodological intervention. To do so, I explore the [contemporary academic literature on note-taking](Paper/Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) as well as the [contributions of the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) online community](Paper/Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) and situate them in relation to feminist concepts of knowledge production. I then consider how notes and their organization can be used support the production of interdisciplinary and justice-oriented knowledges, outlining [four principles which shape my own feminist note-taking methodology](Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) as well as their technical enactment via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a free software I use to render my notes. 

While some attention has been made to emphasize the importance of producing accurate and representational notes—sometimes offering practical tips to inform note-taking practices—there is little discussion about what to do with these notes once they have been produced. This gap has consequences, as the knowledge a note produces is always also informed by its contextual relationships, including its location and its relationship to other notes and ideas. Organizing notes into particular themes, sources, and categories via folders, notebooks, and boxes inform what kind of claims can be made with them in the first place, often siloing particular information from others. Notebooks or digital Documents folders—shared or private—are thus similar to institutional archives in that they are always tied up with power: They inform what is worth knowing and shape how it can be known ([Schwartz & Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20&%20Cook,%202002.md)). **How can we take notes to serve a commitment to producing socially just knowledges? What do we choose what to include in these notes? And how should we organize them, especially in the virtually endless storage capacities of digital systems today?** 

Although notes are rarely framed within the context of social justice, they can inform the collection, synthesis, and retrieval of knowledge, especially in research contexts. This makes note-taking foundational to academic knowledge production and thus worth considering critically in our everyday work. Developing a feminist note-taking system, I argue, presents one ordinary space where new paths can potentially emerge which challenge the "default setting" of academia towards more socially just ends ([Ahmed, 2019](References/Ahmed,%202019.md), p. 160).
