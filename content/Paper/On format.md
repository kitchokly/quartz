The strength of a feminist note-taking system, as [I will come to argue](Paper/Introduction.md), is its networked qualities—a strength that is not necessarily shared with essays or linear arguements. This essay is like most in that it too is fairly linear. However, I have structured it here as a network to demonstrate some of the technical possibilities of a feminist note-taking system. 

I hope that the differences in genre (essay vs note) will not interfere with the argument I am trying to make here. You can also always download this essay as a PDF [here](https://kitchokly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/WMST601_Final_KChokly.pdf).

Feel free to click around, explore, and imagine the possibilities this format might afford you and your own note-taking practice. If you ever wish to return to this [Table of Contents](/), simply click the website title ("[Developing a feminist note-taking system](/)") in the header of the site. I have also included linear navigation links at the bottom of every page. Last, you can always use the backlinks pane and the interactive graph to go to any page which links to the one you are currently on.

Thanks for reading!
