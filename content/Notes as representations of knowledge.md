Most of the literature on note-taking focuses on writing individual notes on a particular topic, usually with an emphasis on their use as memory aids. In Europe, [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that note-taking to support long-term memory emerged in the Renaissance, where notes were often collected, reviewed, and shared with others. The emphasis on sharing and collaboration and the genre of reference books which emerged from these practices shifted note-taking methods to become a generally standardized in the early modern era ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). This includes not just the content of notes but also their organization, as the collection of many-authored notes requires clear headings and the use of finding devices to locate any particular information ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). Note-taking was largely considered a research tool, however, and students in early universities largely did not take notes in lecture contexts ([Clark, 2008](References/Clark,%202008.md); [Marin & Sturm, 2021](References/Marin%20&%20Sturm,%202021.md)). 

Today, note-taking has become an encouraged practiced for students, although [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that note-taking has become "more idiosyncratic to each note-taker" (p. 63). This is supported by some research on student note-taking which suggests a lack of systemic note-taking practices among post-secondary students ([Morehead et al, 2019](References/Morehead%20et%20al,%202019.md)). Further research strives to remedy this issue by offering practical tips note-takers can apply to their own practices, which includes a sub-genre of instructional guides aimed at students (see [Broadwater (2003)](References/Broadwater,%202003.md), [Rohde (2013)](References/Rohde,%202013.md), and [Perry et al. (2018)](References/Perry%20et%20al,%202018.md). The most common assertion, however, is that taking good notes is not necessarily about being systematic but most importantly about properly representing that which is being noted ([Gimenez & Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20&%20Pinel,%202013.md); [Tinny & Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20&%20Nhamo,%202013.md)).

This emphasis on representational accuracy is important. As [Gimenez & Patel (2013)](References/Gimenez%20&%20Pinel,%202013.md)argue, notes represent what the researcher observes as relevant about an object of study and are used to inform subsequent analysis of that object once it is no longer within view. The recognition that notes are always limited by the researcher's interpretation of an event or object of study and their ability to represent it on paper brings this general body of literature to ask how the researcher determines what is or is not relevant to ensure note accuracy. Some respond to this issue by suggesting we introduce visual, audio, and audiovisual media to capture information without requiring the researcher to discern what is or is not noteworthy in the moment ([Tinny & Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20&%20Nhamo,%202013.md)). Others suggest using templates to help note-takers to consider overlooked types of information and thus increase the representativeness of their data ([Gimenez & Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20&%20Pinel,%202013.md))
