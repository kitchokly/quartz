 > Today I’ll be outlining four principles of what I call networked note-taking—a note-taking strategy that has been going on for over a century, but has recently gained popularity in online productivity spaces. I aim to center these principles within feminist efforts to challenge the power structures involved in academic knowledge production.
 > 
 > Before we dig in, you may have noticed that this presentation takes a bit of a different format: I’ve actually built it and the paper it’s drawing from using the same infrastructure as my networked note-taking system, and published it online to demonstrate some of its technical capacities.
 > 
 > I invite you to explore this networked structure on your own by following this link. The site also includes the original version of the paper, its sources—which I encourage you to check out if this interests you—as well as this presentation and its transcript, if you find that useful.
