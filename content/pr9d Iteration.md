 > There’s no hard and fast rule here about what makes up an atomic “idea”—but this system requires treating notes as living, situated thoughts. These means they need to be adjusted as we encounter new ideas and our thinking changes. Reviewing notes each time they surface in relation to others can help add new content to an idea; divide it into several new, atomic notes; or link it to others.

 > Iteration doesn’t just apply to individual notes: It also applies to the system itself, which should ultimately work with you, the researcher. This means reflecting on what’s working and what isn’t.
