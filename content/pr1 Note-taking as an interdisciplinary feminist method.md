 > Hi everyone, I’m Kit. My research surrounds transgender media studies—but today, I’m going to be talking about something which has become a bit of a side interest for me as I move through grad school: that is, note-taking systems.
 > 
 > Before we dig in, though, you may have noticed that this presentation takes a bit of a different format: I’ve actually built it and the paper it’s drawing from using the same structure as the note-taking system I’m going to be talking about today and published it online to demonstrate some of its technical capacities.

 > You’re welcome to use this link to follow along with the presentation, which includes a transcript, image alt-text, sources, and the original paper it draws from.
