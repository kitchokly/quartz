## Feminist concerns with representation

* What is considered note-worthy?
* Feminist emphasis on subjectivity in knowledge production
  * Standpoint theory ([Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md))
  * Sitpoint theory ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md))
  * Situated knowledges ([Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md))
* Notes are always subjective and connected to context
