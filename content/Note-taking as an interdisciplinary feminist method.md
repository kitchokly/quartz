 > Hi everyone, my name is Kit and Iâ€™m a PhD student in Communication Studies here. Today Iâ€™m going to talk about something which has become a bit of a side interest for me over the past year or so, and thatâ€™s note-taking as a form of knowledge production.
 > 
 > Throughout my time in graduate school, Iâ€™ve had some issues with note-taking. I take notes to help me remember what I learnâ€¦ but I take so many notes that I kept forgetting about the factÂ that I took a particular note in the first place. 
 > 
 > So my notes were generally looking like thisâ€”a seemingly-organized box of notebooks containing many notes that *could and did* relate to each other, but I was failing to actually make those connections. This meant I was doing a lot of repetitive work and missing entire bodies of knowledge in my research which I had actually already encountered before.
 > 
 > This brought me into researching some of the histories and methodological principles of note-taking. And considering how much of what Iâ€™ve found in these spaces emerge from academiaâ€™s history of colonialism and todayâ€™s always-on productivity culture, I wanted to see if I could take some of these principles while remaining oriented towards social justice.
