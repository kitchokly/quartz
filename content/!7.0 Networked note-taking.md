* Growing online community and increasing number of software options
* Networked note-taking is not technologically determined
  * Records of networked note-taking systems dating back to the 18th century
  * Even books are not as linear as we think!

 > This last point specifically brings me to what I’ve come to call networked note-taking. Networked note-taking means finding ways to make connections within and between the variety of notes we take, where these connections actually contribute to producing knowledge beyond the sum total of individual notes.
 > 
 > There’s a growing community of networked note-taking enthusiasts appearing online right now, with many debates about the many apps and platforms available today to support such a system.
 > 
 > As a media studies scholar, it’s important for me to emphasize that networked note-taking is not a method which only emerged with the invention of digital hyperlinks like I’m using now. Scholars have actually been using tools like index cards with unique reference IDs to make links across their notes since at least the 18th century. And as Johanna Drucker reminds us, books have always been nonlinear, weaving connections between and through text, commentary, and paratext.
 > 
 > This is to say that these principles are not attached to a particular technology, although different technologies will have different affordances which shape how they can be put into practice, for better or worse.
