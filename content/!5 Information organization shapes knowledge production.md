## Information organization shapes knowledge production

* Proximity of documents create context for interpretation
  * e.g., Archives ([Schwartz & Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20&%20Cook,%202002.md))
  * Similar thing happens in your My Documents folder

 > 
 > This relationality points to the way that information collection and organization shapes what knowledge we can produce.
 > 
 > We can see this happening on institutional levels: For example, archives don’t just document the past; they actively shape constructions of the past by the way they store and present different information. The placement of one record next to another offers evidence of a shared context and begins to piece together a story which is formed by what is present, how it’s represented, and where its placed, as well as what is not present at all.
 > 
 > Rather than offering a clear path towards meaning, the organization of this information is also part of the construction of knowledge, be it within the fonds of an archive or the Documents folder on a personal computer–or my milk crates.
 > 
 > Since notes are some of our data sources and are always in relation with the world and each other, note-taking must go beyond the singular emphasis on note content and representation to *also* consider the system which puts notes in context with each other.
