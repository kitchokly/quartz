 > Note-taking has always been a part of our research methods and therefore worth doing with intention. Understanding note-taking as a feminist method asks that we think about what we consider note-worthy and how we represent our sources, even in our personal writing. It also asks that we think about how we come to bring these ideas into relation with others throughout our research process.

 > Critically, a good note-taking system is informed by the person who uses it. Everyone works differently and has different research goals--there is definitely no one-size-fits all for networked note-taking. If anything, though, I think this underlines the possibilities of note-taking as an interdisciplinary feminist methodâ€”one which I think can support a huge variety of research dedicated to producing more socially just knowledges.

 > I hope these principles have helped you think about your own note-taking processes, and as always, would love to chat more about your own approaches too. Thank you.
