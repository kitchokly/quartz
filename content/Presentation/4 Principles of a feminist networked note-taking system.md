 > This last point specifically brings me to what Iâ€™ve come to call networked note-taking. Networked note-taking means finding ways to make connections within and between the variety of notes we take, where these connections actually contribute to producing knowledge beyond the sum total of individual notes.
 > 
 > Thereâ€™s a growing community of networked note-taking enthusiasts appearing online right now, with many debates about the many apps and platforms available today to support such a system.
 > 
 > As a media studies scholar, itâ€™s important for me to emphasize that networked note-taking is not a method which only emerged with the invention of digital hyperlinks like Iâ€™m using now. Scholars have actually been using tools like index cards with unique reference IDs to make links across their notes since at least the 18th century. And as Johanna Drucker reminds us, books have always been nonlinear, weaving together connections between and through text, commentary, and paratext.
 > 
 > This is to say that these principles are not attached to a particular technology, although different technologies will have different affordances which shape how they can be put into practice, for better or worse. Iâ€™m happy to talk more about this online community as well as technical questions in the Q&A or check out the link for the original paper, which includes further resources.
