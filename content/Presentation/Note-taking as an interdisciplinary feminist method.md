 > Hi everyone, my name is Kit and Iâ€™m a PhD student in Communication Studies here. Today Iâ€™m going to talk about something which has become a bit of a side interest for me over the past year or so, and thatâ€™s note-taking as a form of knowledge production.
 > 
 > Throughout my time in graduate school, Iâ€™ve had some issues with note-taking. I take notes to help me remember what I learnâ€¦ but I take so many notes that I kept forgetting about the factÂ that I took a specific note in the first place. So I was taking notes in one context, and then find it difficult to bring them into a new context where I would actually use them.
 > 
 > So my notes were generally looking like thisâ€”a seemingly-organized box of notebooks containing many notes that *could* relate to each other, but no way to actually make those connections. This meant I was doing a lot of repetitive work and missing entire bodies of knowledge in my research which I had actually already encountered before.
