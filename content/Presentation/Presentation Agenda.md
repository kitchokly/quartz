 > So today Iâ€™ll be outlining four principles of what I call networked note-taking. I aim to center these principles within efforts to challenge the power structures involved in academic knowledge productionâ€”an intentionally interdisciplinary and feminist approach to research.
 > 
 > Before we dig in, you may have noticed that this presentation takes a bit of a different format: Iâ€™ve actually built it and the paper itâ€™s drawing from using the same infrastructure as my networked note-taking system and published it online to demonstrate some of its technical capacities.
 > 
 > As I hope to show today, my feminist approach to note-taking relies on networked non-linearityâ€”a form which is quite different from a linear presentation or a paper like this. So I invite you to explore this networked structure on your own by following this link. The site also includes the original version of the paper, as well as this presentation and its transcript if you find that useful.
