 > Last is iteration. This means a note is not necessarily complete once itâ€™s written. Future insights will likely come to shape a note slightly differently, or encourage it to be merged with another noteâ€”or separated into further notes. This principle recognizes that notes in a networked note-taking system are living ideas, so donâ€™t be afraid to make changes as you goâ€”actually, I encourage it. Regularly reviewing notes and their connections is a useful way to make sure that they meet our research needs, with the added benefit of bringing older notes back to mind to develop future connections.
