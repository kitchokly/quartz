## On format

The strength of a feminist note-taking system, [as I argue](Introduction.md), is its networked qualities—a strength that is not necessarily shared with generally linear essays or presentations. This work is like most in that it too is fairly linear. However, I have structured it here as a network to demonstrate some of the technical possibilities of a feminist networked note-taking system. I hope that the differences in genre (essay or presentation vs note) will not interfere with the argument I am trying to make here. You can also always [download the paper as a PDF here](https://kitchokly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KChokly_NetworkedNote-takingAsFeministResearchMethod.pdf).

Please click around, explore, and imagine the possibilities this format might afford you and your own note-taking practice. Thanks for reading!
