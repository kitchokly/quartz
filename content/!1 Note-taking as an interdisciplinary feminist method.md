 > Hi everyone, my name is Kit and I’m a PhD student in Communication Studies. Today I’m going to talk about something which has become a bit of a side interest for me over the past year or so, and that’s note-taking as a form of knowledge production.
 > 
 > Throughout my time in grad school, I’ve had some issues with note-taking. My research focuses on media representation and trans people, so I take a lot of screenshots. But I also write notes to myself in notebooks, not to mention the plethora of Word Docs and highlighted PDFs.
 > 
 > So my notes generally end up looking like this—a couple of boxes and many, many folders,  containing notes that *can and do* relate to each other but I’m not sure how. This meant I was doing a lot of repetitive research and missing things in my reading which I had actually already encountered before.
 > 
 > This brought me into researching some of the histories and methodological principles of note-taking. And considering how much of what I’ve found in these spaces emerge from academia’s history of colonialism and today’s always-on productivity culture, I wanted to see if I could use some of these principles while remaining oriented towards social justice. How does note-taking shape our knowledge production? How can we use note-taking with intention?
