 > So I decided to give networked note-taking a shot, striving to integrate the seemingly isolated worlds of feminist epistemology alongside the techy-hustle culture of PKM. Drawing on both these spaces, I decided to use a community-supported piece of freeware called Obsidian to view my notes, which are stored as plain Markdown files and are easy to pull out of Obsidian if need be. I also came to four guiding rules for my system, which I call ‚Äúnodes‚Äù to emphasize their structuring relationality with each other. I‚Äôm going to do a short overview of these in the rest of my time here, but more details and their technical implementation are available in the paper.
