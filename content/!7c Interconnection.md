This brings us to linking notes. The principle of interconnection is the core of this system. Refusing to rely on containers or drawn out details to find, organize, and contextualize our notes means we must instead turn to the use of *other* notes to function in these capacities.

This means linking notes liberally to create flexible and even novel contexts for ideas and concepts—the creative process of knowledge production. Linking our notes makes us rethink research as a process of relationship building, rather than just recording observations and literature.
