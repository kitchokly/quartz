This banality positions note-taking as practice requiring little explanation: We read something, attend a lecture, or make a research observation, and then commit it to paper (digital or otherwise), storing it for retrieval at a later date (or not).</description></item><item><title>Notes as constructions of knowledge</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Notes-as-constructions-of-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Notes-as-constructions-of-knowledge/</guid><description>An exception to the concern for note accuracy stems from approaches which recognize the constitutive rather than representational role note-taking plays in the production of knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Notes as representations of knowledge</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Notes-as-representations-of-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Notes-as-representations-of-knowledge/</guid><description>Most of the literature on note-taking focuses on writing individual notes on a particular topic, usually with an emphasis on their use as memory aids.</description></item><item><title>Notes as structures of knowledge</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Notes-as-structures-of-knowledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Notes-as-structures-of-knowledge/</guid><description>Whether understood as materializations of memory or the process of situated thought itself, notes do not stand alone: They are always in relation to other thoughts, ideas, and observations.</description></item><item><title>On format</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/On-format/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/On-format/</guid><description>The strength of a feminist note-taking system, as I will come to argue, is its networked qualitiesâ€”a strength that is not necessarily shared with essays or linear arguements.</description></item><item><title>Principle of atomicity</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-atomicity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-atomicity/</guid><description>Write notes to include only one idea Establishing a networked note-taking system requires reconceptualizing what makes up a note. Primarily, we are concerned here with notes which contain ideas: Notes on other types of information such as biographical data or shopping lists are not necessarily the most useful within the network (although biographical data can be usefully linked to particular ideas as a form of citation, as this digital paper strives to demonstrate).</description></item><item><title>Principle of flatness</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-flatness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-flatness/</guid><description>Store notes in one container Whether working on a computer or on paper, typical file structures rely on folders and subfolders to organize information.</description></item><item><title>Principle of interconnection</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-interconnection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-interconnection/</guid><description>Link notes liberally Refusing to rely on containers or long-winded details to organize and contextualize our notes means we must instead turn to the use of other notes to function in these capacities.</description></item><item><title>Principle of iteration</title><link>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-iteration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kitchokly.github.io/quartz/Paper/Principle-of-iteration/</guid><description>Review and re-evaluate notes periodically The last principle of a networked note-taking system is the principle of iteration. A note is not necessarily complete once it is written.</description></item></channel></rss>
