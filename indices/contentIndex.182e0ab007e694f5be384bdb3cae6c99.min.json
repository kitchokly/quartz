Primarily, we are concerned here with notes which contain ideas: Notes on other types of information such as biographical data or shopping lists are not necessarily the most useful within the network (although biographical data can be usefully linked to particular ideas as a form of citation). Critically, however, these ideas can and should come from a variety of sources. Taking note of the ideas we encounter in our day-to-day life, not just academic literature, is an important way to diversify the knowledges we produce.\n\nWorking with ideas is where the strength of the network happens (see Figure 1). Unlike traditional idea-notes where one note is meant to capture the entire context of a reading, lecture, or observation session, however, [networked note-taking](Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) relies on other notes for context. This means that individual notes are much shorter than traditional notes and are meant to capture one clear idea, or what [Christian Tietze (2013)](References/Tietze,%202013.md) describes as atomicity, where the note-taker must keep relevant notes close together, but ultimately ‚Äúseparate concerns from one another‚Äù‚Äîa concept which he derives from software engineering (para. 24).[Andy Matuschak (n.d.-b)](References/Matuschak,%20nd-b.md) adds that atomicity is useful because it makes connections across notes much more specific.\n\nAtomicity can be difficult to enact because it requires drawing boundaries around what makes up a complete idea, a concept which has blurry boundaries to begin with. Overly-atomized notes do not stand on their own and require too much traversing across the system to understand, while notes which are not atomized enough are difficult to link to others. In general, however, it is helpful to keep in mind that [iteration](Iteration.md) encourages reviewing and revising notes as they are added to the system, presenting an opportunity to grow or divide a note as appropriate.\n\nFigure 1. *An atomic note in relation to others*\n\n![A network graph of nodes.

And as I packed up my small apartment to move into my new, even smaller apartment, I came across these: the notes I had taken over my time at Carleton, where I studied Communication in both my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees. And despite already being conveniently in boxes, I couldn‚Äôt help but leaf through them.\n\nI have little recollection of taking most of these notes, but going through them I found evidence of my own struggle to understand concepts I now use regularly, as well as explorations of ideas I have since moved away from. But a lot of them also included a lot of interesting things I had completely forgotten about. There were notes on fascinating articles I hardly remember reading, details about concepts which would have been *so* useful in that thesis I had just submitted, and even somewhat promising research questions I had written to my future self. Despite the fact I would have to drag them up to my new third-floor walk-up, I decided they would have to come with me in my move.\n\nThey also got me thinking, though. I had been meticulous in my note-*taking*, and this had served me quite well in my classes and research at the time. But once those projects had ended, it seems like the use of these notes had ended too: the notebook was closed and stored in a milk crate. And this doesn‚Äôt even consider the many half-baked ideas I have jotted on post-its or typed into Word files and note-taking apps over the years. There was evidently a disconnect between taking these notes and using them as I moved forward into new projects‚Äîa problem that seemed especially poignant as I was starting a PhD.\n\n![Slide4.jpeg](Slide4.jpeg)\n\n![Slide5.jpeg](Slide5.jpeg)\n\n![Slide6.jpeg](Slide6.jpeg)\n\n![Slide7.jpeg](Slide7.jpeg)\n\n![Slide8.jpeg](Slide8.jpeg)\n\n![Slide9.jpeg](Slide9.jpeg)\n\n![Slide10.jpeg](Slide10.jpeg)\n\n![Slide11.jpeg](Slide11.jpeg)\n\n![Slide12.jpeg](Slide12.jpeg)\n\n![Slide13.jpeg](Slide13.jpeg)\n\n![Slide14.jpeg](Slide14.jpeg)\n\n![Slide15.jpeg](Slide15.jpeg)\n\n![Slide16.jpeg](Slide16.jpeg)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.232740115Z","tags":[]},"/Conclusion":{"title":"Conclusion: Adopting a feminist note-taking system","content":"\nNotes are generally considered important (if dull) aspects of learning and research ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md); [Morehead et al, 2019](References/Morehead%20et%20al,%202019.md); [Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)). Most methodological approaches to note-taking, however, focus on the [representational](Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) or [constitutive](Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) role of individual notes in the knowledges they produce. And while some analyses of institutional knowledge management critique a lack of attention to the always-present power dynamics of file organization ([Gitelman, 2014](References/Gitelman,%202014.md); [Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md); [Vismann, 2008](References/Vismann,%202008.md)), these critiques have not been explored in relation to personal note-taking methods. The growing PKM community, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of [structure](Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) in the production of knowledge via notes ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)), but tends to avoid considering who these knowledges serve or thinking critically about the types of neoliberal subjects their rhetoric produces. Alongside these explorations of the role of notes and files in knowledge production, feminist theorists continue to urge that we critically consider how hegemonic power structures shape what knowledges are knowable by whom ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md); [Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md); [Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)), their accepted validity ([Hill Collins, 1989](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md)), and who benefits from them ([TallBear, 2014](References/TallBear,%202014.md)). \n\nBringing these bodies of work together, we can see that establishing a note-taking practice is one space where feminist practices can be enacted in the effort to produce more socially just research. My feminist note-taking methodology is my own effort to do so, using [atomicity](Atomicity.md), [flatness](Flatness.md), [interconnection](Interconnection.md), and [iteration](Iteration.md) to finding novel connections between unexpected sources. to find novel connections between unexpected sources. It is no small feat to adopt a new note-taking system. Not only does this approach encourage rethinking exactly what a note should be, but it also requires getting to know new software. This is compounded further by the way that a network of notes relies on note volume as well as to note quality. Reaching this critical mass can be daunting, but is incredibly rewarding: As the volume of notes grows, new patterns emerge which would have been easily overlooked otherwise‚Äîand once recognized, these patterns become easy motivators to continue maintaining a note-taking system, rewarding not just for the new ideas they can bring to light but also their potential to challenge the status quo of institutional knowledge production and support underrepresented voices.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Four nodes of a feminist note-taking methodology](Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) | [üìñ Works cited  üëâ](Works%20cited.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.232740115Z","tags":[]},"/Flatness":{"title":"Flatness","content":"\n## Store notes in as few containers necessary\n\nWhether working on a computer or on paper, typical file structures rely on folders and subfolders to organize information. A folder, notebook, drawer, or box all act as containers for similar notes, the common thread between them defined by the filing system. These categories are usually determined by either the notes‚Äô intended use or the context of its collection: Students may label these containers temporally and thematically by course and/or semester, for example, and researchers often use labels informed by a topic, field, theme, or project.\n\nCategory containers like these are quite useful in that they divide large volumes of files into smaller, contextual groups, making them much easier to find. One practical downside with containers is that they do not scale. Too many files in one folder may not only be physically unwieldy, but it quickly returns us to the original problem of having too large of a volume of files to give any of them context or even be findable without a robust search tool. Another downside are the impacts of folder hierarchies on knowledge production, a concern explored above: The context that containers provide necessarily informs the meaning of the notes they hold. A note filed under one course code or field, for example, will always be understood in relation to that course or field, and the other notes generated from the course or field. This prevents the cross-fertilization of ideas across the boundaries by which they are filed, meaning not only that it is more difficult to generate new ideas from your notes, but that you also risk duplicating work you have already done, just in a different context.\n\nPutting notes in one container or foot folder (see Figure 2) may seem to risk losing them in a disorganized mess, especially when since atomized notes increases their volume. However, a digital system means that search and metadata filtering and ordering such as file name, data added, date modified, and file type can be useful to track down specific notes. Most importantly, flatness works around the siloing of notes into externally imposed categories. Flattening instead encourages ideas to find new context amongst themselves, enabling the generation of new and unexpected ideas, leading us to Node 3: [interconnection](Interconnection.md).\n\nFigure 2. *Storing notes in the root folder*\n\n![A screenshot of a file folder system listing approximately 25 Markdown files.

In the remainder of this essay, I name four brief concepts foundational to a feminist note-taking methodology. I call these nodes to reflect their relationality, as no one concept is more important than the other. They are all required to work together to establish a feminist note network.\n\nWhile it is possible to enact this system using analog means (as Luhmann and Moser demonstrate), I use digital technologies to enact this system. This includes writing notes in Markdown, a human-readable language which enables heading structures and basic text formatting like italics, bold, links, and blockquotes. Critically, Markdown enables not just hyperlinks to outside resources but also links between other Markdown files.[^1]\n\nWhile Markdown is human readable, it requires software to render its links and formatting. Consider software a window through which notes written in Markdown can be read, edited, interacted with, and navigated between. The software I use for note-taking and is subsequently used in my visual examples is called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a robust, local, and free software which renders Markdown. One especially useful aspect of Obsidian is the ability to render a list or graph of all files which link to another. This allows the user to navigate both forward and backward through their linked notes. In my eyes, however, the primary advantage of Obsidian is that the files it renders are entirely local. This means that Obsidian requires no internet connection and is therefore much more reliable and secure than cloud-based note-taking systems. Obsidian is used by many in the PKM community and has a multitude of community-made plugins which can adapt the software to fit individual needs.[^2] Of course, since Markdown is not linked to a particular software, it is relatively simply to move one‚Äôs notes to another rendering software if Obsidian stops being supported or useful to you.\n\nLast, the ideas in these nodes draw on strategies outlined by several thinkers working and sharing in the PKM scene, many of whom offer their own principles and guides to note-taking. Importantly, however, there is no distinct ‚Äúright way‚Äù to take notes: Note-taking systems are unique to the individuals writing and reading these notes, their intended uses, and the underlying technologies available. Feminist perspectives on methods echo this notion, stressing the importance of context and social location on research processes ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md)). These methods are no exception. I hope, however, that it can encourage other students and researchers to critically examine the impacts of their own note-taking practices on their work, and perhaps inspire the development of additional note-taking methodologies which hold social justice at their core‚Äîproducing new and varying methods I hope will also be shared with others.\n\n## The four nodes\n\n1.

This means linking notes liberally to create flexible and perhaps even novel contexts for ideas and concepts (see Figure 3). As [Matuschak (n.d.-c)](References/Matuschak,%20nd-c.md) writes, \"If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we‚Äôre thinking about\" (para. 1). Not only does this mean our notes become non-hierarchical and non-linear, but it also enables a profound creativity in our writing which can lead us to unexpected places for research. This creativity is critical for social justice-oriented research. As [TallBear (2014)](References/TallBear,%202014.md) argues:\n\n \u003e \n \u003e It is also helpful to think creatively about the research process as a relationship-building process, as a professional networking process with colleagues (not ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù), as an opportunity for conversation and sharing of knowledge, not simply data gathering. Research must then be conceived in less linear ways without necessarily knowable goals at the outset. (p. 2)\n\nHere, TallBear is referring to the relations of researchers and other people involved in research, but as [Gibbs (2007)](References/Gibbs,%202007.md) argues, relationships can manifest in our notes, too. Notes are not just for recording observations from the field and literature reviews but also for recording interesting conversations and other nontraditional sources of knowledge. Linking these notes together introduces the validity institutional knowledge requires with the multitude of knowledges it frequent excludes.\n\nThe foundation of Luhmann‚Äôs system involved finding ways to link notes via analog mean. Markdown, however, is a language which formats plan text and enables linking between files. Simply encasing a text string within square brackets transforms it into a link to any other note within the container which shares the string as its title. This allows us to make a link to another idea within a sentence, much like the links found on Wikipedia.\n\nFigure 3. *A note with links*\n\n![A screenshot fro Obsidian of a note titled \"social construction of technology (SCOT),\" which describes the theory with links to other concepts such as \"relevant social group\" and sources such as \"@PinchBijker1985.\"](Figure3.png)\n\n*Note.* This brief note offers an overview of a theoretical model with additional key concepts (e.g., relevant social group, Kuhnian paradigm, interpretive flexibility) and literature (e.g., Pinch \u0026 Bjiker, 1984; Nagy \u0026 Neff, 2015; Noble, 2016) linked through out in blue text or under ‚ÄúLinked mentions,‚Äù a list of notes which link to this note (also known as a backlink).\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Four nodes overview](Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e 1.

This banality positions note-taking as practice requiring little explanation: We read something, attend a lecture, or make a research observation, and then commit it to paper (digital or otherwise), storing it for retrieval at a later date (or not). As educators [Lavinia Marin and Sean Sturm (2021)](References/Marin%20\u0026%20Sturm,%202021.md) point out, note-taking is largely considered a mechanical process at best and boring and ineffective at worst. But to take note is to quite literally define what is considered notable, and, by extension, what is not ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md)). These noted observations then become evidence for the claims we make. Notes may not be frequently discussed, but they are part of the very foundation of the institutional production knowledge. \n\nBound up with my own frustration with note-taking as a graduate student in the overlapping space of social sciences and humanities, I use this paper to position [notes as critical media for academic knowledge production](Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) and thus one useful space for feminist methodological intervention. To do so, I situate this piece in the [existing literature on notes and note-taking](Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) as well as the [contributions of the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) online community](Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) in relation to feminist concepts of knowledge production. I then consider how notes and their organization can be used support the production of interdisciplinary and justice-oriented knowledges, outlining [four intertwined concepts which shape my own note-taking methodology](Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) as well as their technical enactment via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a free software I use to render my own notes. \n\nWhile some attention has been made to emphasize the importance of producing accurate and representational notes‚Äîsometimes offering practical tips to inform note-taking practices‚Äîthere is little discussion about what to do with these notes once they have been produced. This gap has consequences, as the knowledge a note produces is always also informed by its contextual relationships, including its location and its relationship to other notes and ideas. Organizing notes into particular themes, sources, and categories via folders, notebooks, and boxes inform what kind of claims can be made with them in the first place, often siloing particular information from others. Notebooks or digital My Documents folders‚Äîshared or private‚Äîare thus similar to institutional archives in that they are always tied up with power: They inform what is worth knowing and shape how it can be known ([Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md)). **How can we take notes to serve a commitment to producing socially just knowledges? What do we choose what to include in these notes? And how should we organize them, especially in the virtually endless storage capacities of digital systems today?** \n\nNotes are rarely framed within the context of social justice but they can inform the collection, synthesis, and retrieval of knowledge, especially in research contexts. This makes note-taking foundational to academic knowledge production and thus worth considering critically in our everyday work. Developing a networked note-taking system, I argue, presents one ordinary space where new paths can potentially emerge which challenge the ‚Äúdefault setting‚Äù of academia towards more socially just ends ([Ahmed, 2019](References/Ahmed,%202019.md), p. 160). \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Table of Contents](Table%20of%20contents.md) | [üìñ Notes as representations of knowledge üëâ](Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.272740604Z","tags":[]},"/Iteration":{"title":"Iteration","content":"\n## Review and re-evaluate notes periodically\n\nA note is not necessarily complete once it is written.

Notes in a networked note-taking system are living ideas, and should be reviewed periodically to ensure they still fit your needs.\n\nThe liveliness of notes and the need to maintain them brings a number of PKM contributors to use gardening metaphors to describe their networked note-taking systems (see [Ang (2021)](References/Ang,%202021.md) and [Matuschak (n.d.-a)](References/Matuschak,%20nd-a.md)). I hesitate with the naturalization of knowledge some of these metaphors imply, which risk ignoring that knowledge as always socially produced and situated. They do, however, usefully demonstrate the value of tending to your note-taking system. The system should serve its users,[^3] and if it becomes unwieldy, it should be adapted. Often, PKM community members have already developed solutions to particular issues‚Äî[Nick Milo (n.d.)](References/Milo,%20nd.md), for example, suggests creating specific ‚ÄúMap of Content‚Äù notes which contain no ideas but simply lists related notes to view them all from a macro perspective. An attention to scalability and implications for social justice should continue to be centered, however. Regularly reviewing notes and their connections is a useful way to ensure they meet our research needs, with the added benefit of bringing older notes back to mind to develop future connections.\n\n[^3]: Although Obsidian renders local Markdown files, saving these files on cloud storage allows others to contribute to the note-taking system as if they were also local on their own machines.

This suggests that representational accuracy should not be the sole goal for good note-taking as it ignores the role of the researcher in their observations and the knowledges they produce ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md)). \n\nThis assertion follows the central claims of feminist thought which challenges the notion of objective knowledge. Feminist theorists have long been concerned with the relationship between ontology and epistemology; that is, how people producing knowledge come to inform these knowledges ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md); [Hemmings, 2015](References/Hemmings,%202015.md); [TallBear, 2014](References/TallBear,%202014.md)). For example, social theorist [Patricia Hill Collins (1989)](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md) argues that the exclusion of Black women from education, literacy, and jobs has led to tendency of white men to control the process of knowledge validation. This contributes to a teleological argument where the dominant group is convinced of *both* Black and female intellectual inferiority, suppressing the legitimacy of Black feminist in institutional spaces. In response, feminists have pushed to legitimate experiential and embodied knowledges in institutional spaces, developing theoretical frameworks like standpoint theory ([Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)), sitpoint theory ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md)), situated knowledges ([Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md)), each of which varyingly stresses the importance of intersectional, embodied positionality in the production of knowledge.\n\nThese theories rest on the notion that research and researchers, like all aspects of¬†knowledge production, are always already entangled([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md)). Method is thus inseparable from both the research problem and the researcher, shaping questions, problems, and solutions in its enactment. Good research involves acknowledging these messy entanglements and multiplicities, reckoning with our own¬†positions and knowledges as well as the knowledges of those around us. Reflecting on the always situated nature of writing, Communication Studies scholar [Anna Gibbs (2007)](References/Gibbs,%202007.md) thus argues that writing is \"a mode of inquiry in its own right\" (p. 222) which does not just *support* various research methods but should actually be framed as *a method in itself*. This makes writing notes a methodological process:\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Writing, then, cannot be a methodological ‚Äòtool‚Äô in any simple sense. It is, rather, a process, implicitly dialogical, in conversation with the world, with other writing, and, reflexively, with itself. It is this very means of procedure‚Äîa turning and returning‚Äîthat characterizes it as an affective methodology. ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md), p.  224)\n\nBy focusing on writing notes as not just a tool but a method which always involves the writer as a part of what is written, Gibbs emphasizes research as a creative rather than descriptive process. This shifts the emphasis of notes as a *support* for research into a *direct* form of research, a shift which is reflected in work attuned to feminist values. Is not uncommon to now find research which includes vignettes of personal field notes, journals, and even poetry stemming from a variety of fields and research topics (e.g., [Stewart, 2007](References/Stewart,%202007.md), [Stryker, 1994](References/Stryker,%201994.md), and [Van Wyck, 2010](References/Van%20Wyck,%202010.md)). These works bring the situated knowledge of the researcher into their research, legitimizing lived experience as a valuable form of academic inquiry and thus contributing to the growing diversity in institutional knowledge production.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Notes as representations of knowledge](Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) | [üìñ Notes as structures of knowledge üëâ](Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.2887408Z","tags":[]},"/Notes-as-representations-of-knowledge":{"title":"Notes as representations of knowledge","content":"\nMost of the literature on note-taking focuses on writing individual notes on a particular topic, usually with an emphasis on their use as memory aids. Historian [Ann Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that European note-taking used to support long-term memory emerged in the Renaissance, where notes were often collected, reviewed, and shared with others. The emphasis on sharing and collaboration and the genre of reference books which emerged from these practices shifted note-taking methods to become a generally standardized in the early modern era ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). This includes not just the content of notes but also their organization, as the collection of many-authored notes requires clear headings and the use of finding devices to locate any particular information ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). Note-taking was largely considered a research tool, however, and students in early universities largely did not take notes in lecture contexts ([Clark, 2008](References/Clark,%202008.md); [Marin \u0026 Sturm, 2021](References/Marin%20\u0026%20Sturm,%202021.md)). \n\nToday, note-taking has become an encouraged practice for students, although [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that note-taking has become \"more idiosyncratic to each note-taker\" (p. 63). This is supported by some research on student note-taking which suggests a lack of systemic note-taking practices among post-secondary students ([Morehead et al, 2019](References/Morehead%20et%20al,%202019.md)). Further research strives to remedy this issue by offering practical tips note-takers can apply to their own practices, which includes a sub-genre of instructional guides aimed at students (see [Broadwater (2003)](References/Broadwater,%202003.md), [Rohde (2013)](References/Rohde,%202013.md), and [Perry et al. (2018)](References/Perry%20et%20al,%202018.md). The most common assertion, however, is that taking good notes is not necessarily about being systematic but most importantly about representing that which is being noted as accurately as possible ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md); [Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)).\n\nThis emphasis on representational accuracy is important in all contexts. As representations, notes stand in for the object of study and are used to inform subsequent analysis of that object once it is no longer within view. The question thus emerges about how to ensure representational quality of notes, with some suggesting the introduction of visual, audio, and audiovisual media to capture information without requiring the researcher to discern what is or is not noteworthy in the moment ([Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)). This attempts to remedy the problem of representative accuracy through the inclusion of more forms of representation, a critical issue for empirical research. At the same time, however, it is also important to emphasize the researcher‚Äôs always inextricable role in the knowledges which their notes come to construct as they are the one who chooses what is or is not notable. This emphasis is commonly found in feminist research approaches, which recognize the constitutive rather than representational role note-taking plays in the production of knowledge.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Introduction](Introduction.md) | [üìñ Notes as constructions of knowledge üëâ](Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.2887408Z","tags":[]},"/Notes-as-structures-of-knowledge":{"title":"Notes as structures of knowledge","content":"\nWhether understood as materializations of memory or the process of situated thought itself, notes do not stand alone: They are always in relation to other thoughts, ideas, and observations. These relationships are always shaped by power, meaning that feminist note-taking must go beyond the contemporary emphasis on note contents to consider the broader system which places notes in context with each other and structures their retrieval.\n\nFor example, institutions such as museums, libraries, and archives use organizing tools and techniques such as collections, databases, lists, maps, catalogues, and indexes all contribute the meaning of their written contents. Archives do not simply document the past: They actively shape the construction of the past‚Äîof cultural memory‚Äîby the way they store and present different forms of information ([Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md)). The placement of one record next to another offers evidence of a shared context and begins to piece together a story which is as much formed by what is present, where, as what is not present at all ([Vismann, 2008](References/Vismann,%202008.md)). Rather than offering a guide to finding pearls of meaning, the organization of this information is part of the very production of such knowledge‚Äîbe it within the fonds of an archive or the My Documents folder on a personal computer ([Gitelman, 2014](References/Gitelman,%202014.md)).\n\nTurning critically to note organization over note content is not by any means new: Historical studies of early modern European scribal practices emphasize the role of organization over content, turning to indexes, topic-specific notebooks, and even cabinets of keyword slips as solutions to finding information amongst the vastness of one‚Äôs notes (see [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) and [Soll, 2010](References/Soll,%202010.md)). In comparison, however, most contemporary literature on note-taking takes their organization as a given, perhaps due to the reliance of computers on deep folder structures and the availability of keyword searches, tagging, and flexible file ordering. These tools are undoubtably useful for note organization. Still, the lack of attention to the need to clearly connect notes prevents cross-fertilization of ideas between subjects, disciplines, sources, and moments.\n\nThe zettelkasten‚Äîa series of slip boxes containing notes on index cards‚Äîis a popular approach to the problem of note organization. Media historian [Markus Krajewski (2011)](References/Krajewski,%202011.md) traces a genealogy of zettelkasten as ‚Äúthe scholar‚Äôs machine‚Äù (p. 50) by drawing on 18th century German jurist Johann Jacob Moser‚Äôs descriptive use of zettelkasten to generate writing. Moser attributes his prolific (500+) publication record to this method, which includes writing short notes on small slips of paper, filing them in boxes by theme, and then removing them and reorganizing them to form his writing. [Krajewski](References/Krajewski,%202011.md) argues that the crux of the zettelkasten is in the way it affords a personalized cross-referencing system, ‚Äúa kind of argumentative surplus that is the true value added of a box of index cards, while incessantly helping the reader fix his or her \\[sic\\] impressions and associations‚Äù (p. 65). He suggests that the value added by cross-referencing principle of Moser‚Äôs zettelkasten was an inspiration to other writers such as Hegel, who describes the absolute spirit as a ‚Äúhidden box of index cards‚Äù (as cited in [Krajewski, 2011](References/Krajewski,%202011.md), p. 57) due to the way the spirit vanishes within a chain of references. The additional value emerging from the zettelkasten‚Äôs cross-referencing technique brings Krajewski to argue that the zettelkasten is not simply an index tool but a *writing* tool, enabling novel connections between thoughts as opposed to the referential role of a library catalogue.\n\n1950s German sociologist Niklas Luhmann is commonly cited as relying heavily on his own zettelkasten in the production of his prolific writing. Where Luhmann‚Äôs contribution to the system lies is in his use of numbers, letters, slashes, and commas to refer to individual notes‚Äô positions within the larger system ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)). This approach allows notes‚Äô labels to be endlessly expansive, meaning that Luhmann could organize them contextually and always knew their location within his ever-expanding information system. Further, since these labels did not shift as new notes were added to the system, he could also reference existing notes in different areas of the system. Through this ever-expanding reference system, Luhmann created a web of knowledge which ‚Äúvery much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet‚Äù ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md), p. 24))‚Äîan anachronistic analogy which brought Daniel L√ºdecke to develop a free software in 2015, titled Zettelkasten, which digitizes Luhmann‚Äôs process. Rather than cards in a slip box, these notes are now housed in the binary code of the hard drive.\n\nThis attention to digital note-taking has spurred the creation of a loosely-termed ‚ÄúPKM‚Äù (Personal Knowledge Management) scene online. The PKM community is rich for its experimentation and openness to knowledge sharing, and I owe much of my thinking on networked note structures to the many individuals contributing to digital note-taking methods and methodologies. There are [YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanJenksTech), [forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/), and [blogs](https://pkmjournal.com) dedicated to not just taking notes, but to developing and maintaining note-taking systems (e.g., [Dubois, n.d.](References/Dubois,%20nd.md); \\[\\[Jenks, nd|Jenks \\[@BryanJenksTech\\], n.d.\\]\\]; [r/PKMS, n.d.](References/r%20PKMS,%20nd.md)). In these spaces, professionals, students, and academics exchange methodological principles for note-taking, experiment with new note-taking software, and sometimes even contribute the creation of such software if they are free and open source.\n\nIn its emphasis on note-taking strategies, however, PKM tends to focus on individual productivity as the ultimate measure of a note-taking system rather than any consideration of the types of knowledge these systems might help produce. For example, the fact that Luhmann wrote over 50 books and over 500 journal articles in his 30-year career using his note-taking system is often cited in PKM spaces ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)) but there are few if any discussions about Luhmann‚Äôs qualitative contributions to his field. The tendency for PKM to glorify productivity via technological means echoes the way digital technologies are largely shaped by neoliberal narratives which treat the internet as a space of profound egalitarianism, despite the dependency of contemporary communications infrastructure on global racial capitalism ([Noble, 2016](References/Noble,%202016.md)). While the free and open source software developed by members of the PKM community is helpful for many, little has been theorized about who and what these systems can be useful *for* outside of a general appeal for neoliberal productivity.\n\nThis is not to say that there is no opportunity for feminist interventions into digital note-taking technologies, however. Describing how database organization is critical to the access and distribution as well as autonomy and privacy of the information it contains, Communication Studies scholar [Cait McKinney (2020)](References/McKinney,%202020.md) outlines a history of feminist \"information activism\": \n\n \u003e \n \u003e This concept brings together people, their visions of justice, and the media they use to organize, store, and provide access to information, a relationship that is key to understanding feminism‚Äôs role in histories of commonplace technologies such as computer databases. (p. 2)\n\nInspired by this history, I see an opportunity to bring a vision of social justice to the networked note organization strategies emerging from PKM. These strategies offer alternatives to the critiques launched against folders and files, bringing notes out of artificially imposed hierarchies and into an always-relational network to bridge disciplines and integrate situated knowledges in a variety of media forms.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Notes as constructions of knowledge](Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) | [üìñ Four nodes of a feminist note-taking methodology üëâ](Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.2887408Z","tags":[]},"/References/Ahmed-2019":{"title":"Ahmed, 2019","content":"\nAhmed, S.

This banality positions note-taking as practice requiring little explanation: We read something, attend a lecture, or make a research observation, and then commit it to paper (digital or otherwise), storing it for retrieval at a later date (or not). As educators [Lavinia Marin and Sean Sturm (2021)](References/Marin%20\u0026%20Sturm,%202021.md) point out, note-taking is largely considered a mechanical process at best and boring and ineffective at worst. But to take note is to quite literally define what is considered notable, and, by extension, what is not ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md)). These noted observations then become evidence for the claims we make. Notes may not be frequently discussed, but they are part of the very foundation of the institutional production knowledge. \n\nBound up with my own frustration with note-taking as a graduate student in the overlapping space of social sciences and humanities, I use this paper to position [notes as critical media for academic knowledge production](pa4%20Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) and thus one useful space for feminist methodological intervention. To do so, I situate this piece in the [existing literature on notes and note-taking](pa3%20Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) as well as the [contributions of the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) online community](pa5%20Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) in relation to feminist concepts of knowledge production. I then consider how notes and their organization can be used support the production of interdisciplinary and justice-oriented knowledges, outlining [four intertwined concepts which shape my own note-taking methodology](pa6%20Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) as well as their technical enactment via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a free software I use to render my own notes. \n\nWhile some attention has been made to emphasize the importance of producing accurate and representational notes‚Äîsometimes offering practical tips to inform note-taking practices‚Äîthere is little discussion about what to do with these notes once they have been produced. This gap has consequences, as the knowledge a note produces is always also informed by its contextual relationships, including its location and its relationship to other notes and ideas. Organizing notes into particular themes, sources, and categories via folders, notebooks, and boxes inform what kind of claims can be made with them in the first place, often siloing particular information from others. Notebooks or digital My Documents folders‚Äîshared or private‚Äîare thus similar to institutional archives in that they are always tied up with power: They inform what is worth knowing and shape how it can be known ([Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md)). **How can we take notes to serve a commitment to producing socially just knowledges? What do we choose what to include in these notes? And how should we organize them, especially in the virtually endless storage capacities of digital systems today?** \n\nNotes are rarely framed within the context of social justice but they can inform the collection, synthesis, and retrieval of knowledge, especially in research contexts. This makes note-taking foundational to academic knowledge production and thus worth considering critically in our everyday work. Developing a networked note-taking system, I argue, presents one ordinary space where new paths can potentially emerge which challenge the ‚Äúdefault setting‚Äù of academia towards more socially just ends ([Ahmed, 2019](References/Ahmed,%202019.md), p. 160). \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Table of Contents](pa1%20table%20of%20contents.md) | [üìñ Notes as representations of knowledge üëâ](pa3%20Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.316741142Z","tags":[]},"/pa3-Notes-as-representations-of-knowledge":{"title":"üìñ Notes as representations of knowledge","content":"\nMost of the literature on note-taking focuses on writing individual notes on a particular topic, usually with an emphasis on their use as memory aids. Historian [Ann Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that European note-taking used to support long-term memory emerged in the Renaissance, where notes were often collected, reviewed, and shared with others. The emphasis on sharing and collaboration and the genre of reference books which emerged from these practices shifted note-taking methods to become a generally standardized in the early modern era ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). This includes not just the content of notes but also their organization, as the collection of many-authored notes requires clear headings and the use of finding devices to locate any particular information ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). Note-taking was largely considered a research tool, however, and students in early universities largely did not take notes in lecture contexts ([Clark, 2008](References/Clark,%202008.md); [Marin \u0026 Sturm, 2021](References/Marin%20\u0026%20Sturm,%202021.md)). \n\nToday, note-taking has become an encouraged practice for students, although [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that note-taking has become \"more idiosyncratic to each note-taker\" (p. 63). This is supported by some research on student note-taking which suggests a lack of systemic note-taking practices among post-secondary students ([Morehead et al, 2019](References/Morehead%20et%20al,%202019.md)). Further research strives to remedy this issue by offering practical tips note-takers can apply to their own practices, which includes a sub-genre of instructional guides aimed at students (see [Broadwater (2003)](References/Broadwater,%202003.md), [Rohde (2013)](References/Rohde,%202013.md), and [Perry et al. (2018)](References/Perry%20et%20al,%202018.md). The most common assertion, however, is that taking good notes is not necessarily about being systematic but most importantly about representing that which is being noted as accurately as possible ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md); [Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)).\n\nThis emphasis on representational accuracy is important in all contexts. As representations, notes stand in for the object of study and are used to inform subsequent analysis of that object once it is no longer within view. The question thus emerges about how to ensure representational quality of notes, with some suggesting the introduction of visual, audio, and audiovisual media to capture information without requiring the researcher to discern what is or is not noteworthy in the moment ([Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)). This attempts to remedy the problem of representative accuracy through the inclusion of more forms of representation, a critical issue for empirical research. At the same time, however, it is also important to emphasize the researcher‚Äôs always inextricable role in the knowledges which their notes come to construct as they are the one who chooses what is or is not notable. This emphasis is commonly found in feminist research approaches, which recognize the constitutive rather than representational role note-taking plays in the production of knowledge.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Introduction](pa2%20Introduction.md) | [üìñ Notes as constructions of knowledge üëâ](pa4%20Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.316741142Z","tags":[]},"/pa4-Notes-as-constructions-of-knowledge":{"title":"üìñ Notes as constructions of knowledge","content":"\nAs a form of writing, note-taking is an inherently creative act, always involving thought rather than simply representing it ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md)). This suggests that representational accuracy should not be the sole goal for good note-taking as it ignores the role of the researcher in their observations and the knowledges they produce ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md)). \n\nThis assertion follows the central claims of feminist thought which challenges the notion of objective knowledge. Feminist theorists have long been concerned with the relationship between ontology and epistemology; that is, how people producing knowledge come to inform these knowledges ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md); [Hemmings, 2015](References/Hemmings,%202015.md); [TallBear, 2014](References/TallBear,%202014.md)). For example, social theorist [Patricia Hill Collins (1989)](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md) argues that the exclusion of Black women from education, literacy, and jobs has led to tendency of white men to control the process of knowledge validation. This contributes to a teleological argument where the dominant group is convinced of *both* Black and female intellectual inferiority, suppressing the legitimacy of Black feminist in institutional spaces. In response, feminists have pushed to legitimate experiential and embodied knowledges in institutional spaces, developing theoretical frameworks like standpoint theory ([Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)), sitpoint theory ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md)), situated knowledges ([Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md)), each of which varyingly stresses the importance of intersectional, embodied positionality in the production of knowledge.\n\nThese theories rest on the notion that research and researchers, like all aspects of¬†knowledge production, are always already entangled([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md)). Method is thus inseparable from both the research problem and the researcher, shaping questions, problems, and solutions in its enactment. Good research involves acknowledging these messy entanglements and multiplicities, reckoning with our own¬†positions and knowledges as well as the knowledges of those around us. Reflecting on the always situated nature of writing, Communication Studies scholar [Anna Gibbs (2007)](References/Gibbs,%202007.md) thus argues that writing is \"a mode of inquiry in its own right\" (p. 222) which does not just *support* various research methods but should actually be framed as *a method in itself*. This makes writing notes a methodological process:\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Writing, then, cannot be a methodological ‚Äòtool‚Äô in any simple sense. It is, rather, a process, implicitly dialogical, in conversation with the world, with other writing, and, reflexively, with itself. It is this very means of procedure‚Äîa turning and returning‚Äîthat characterizes it as an affective methodology. ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md), p.  224)\n\nBy focusing on writing notes as not just a tool but a method which always involves the writer as a part of what is written, Gibbs emphasizes research as a creative rather than descriptive process. This shifts the emphasis of notes as a *support* for research into a *direct* form of research, a shift which is reflected in work attuned to feminist values. Is not uncommon to now find research which includes vignettes of personal field notes, journals, and even poetry stemming from a variety of fields and research topics (e.g., [Stewart, 2007](References/Stewart,%202007.md), [Stryker, 1994](References/Stryker,%201994.md), and [Van Wyck, 2010](References/Van%20Wyck,%202010.md)). These works bring the situated knowledge of the researcher into their research, legitimizing lived experience as a valuable form of academic inquiry and thus contributing to the growing diversity in institutional knowledge production.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Notes as representations of knowledge](pa3%20Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) | [üìñ Notes as structures of knowledge üëâ](pa5%20Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.316741142Z","tags":[]},"/pa5-Notes-as-structures-of-knowledge":{"title":"üìñ Notes as structures of knowledge","content":"\nWhether understood as materializations of memory or the process of situated thought itself, notes do not stand alone: They are always in relation to other thoughts, ideas, and observations. These relationships are always shaped by power, meaning that feminist note-taking must go beyond the contemporary emphasis on note contents to consider the broader system which places notes in context with each other and structures their retrieval.\n\nFor example, institutions such as museums, libraries, and archives use organizing tools and techniques such as collections, databases, lists, maps, catalogues, and indexes all contribute the meaning of their written contents. Archives do not simply document the past: They actively shape the construction of the past‚Äîof cultural memory‚Äîby the way they store and present different forms of information ([Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md)). The placement of one record next to another offers evidence of a shared context and begins to piece together a story which is as much formed by what is present, where, as what is not present at all ([Vismann, 2008](References/Vismann,%202008.md)). Rather than offering a guide to finding pearls of meaning, the organization of this information is part of the very production of such knowledge‚Äîbe it within the fonds of an archive or the My Documents folder on a personal computer ([Gitelman, 2014](References/Gitelman,%202014.md)).\n\nTurning critically to note organization over note content is not by any means new: Historical studies of early modern European scribal practices emphasize the role of organization over content, turning to indexes, topic-specific notebooks, and even cabinets of keyword slips as solutions to finding information amongst the vastness of one‚Äôs notes (see [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) and [Soll, 2010](References/Soll,%202010.md)). In comparison, however, most contemporary literature on note-taking takes their organization as a given, perhaps due to the reliance of computers on deep folder structures and the availability of keyword searches, tagging, and flexible file ordering. These tools are undoubtably useful for note organization. Still, the lack of attention to the need to clearly connect notes prevents cross-fertilization of ideas between subjects, disciplines, sources, and moments.\n\nThe zettelkasten‚Äîa series of slip boxes containing notes on index cards‚Äîis a popular approach to the problem of note organization. Media historian [Markus Krajewski (2011)](References/Krajewski,%202011.md) traces a genealogy of zettelkasten as ‚Äúthe scholar‚Äôs machine‚Äù (p. 50) by drawing on 18th century German jurist Johann Jacob Moser‚Äôs descriptive use of zettelkasten to generate writing. Moser attributes his prolific (500+) publication record to this method, which includes writing short notes on small slips of paper, filing them in boxes by theme, and then removing them and reorganizing them to form his writing. [Krajewski](References/Krajewski,%202011.md) argues that the crux of the zettelkasten is in the way it affords a personalized cross-referencing system, ‚Äúa kind of argumentative surplus that is the true value added of a box of index cards, while incessantly helping the reader fix his or her \\[sic\\] impressions and associations‚Äù (p. 65). He suggests that the value added by cross-referencing principle of Moser‚Äôs zettelkasten was an inspiration to other writers such as Hegel, who describes the absolute spirit as a ‚Äúhidden box of index cards‚Äù (as cited in [Krajewski, 2011](References/Krajewski,%202011.md), p. 57) due to the way the spirit vanishes within a chain of references. The additional value emerging from the zettelkasten‚Äôs cross-referencing technique brings Krajewski to argue that the zettelkasten is not simply an index tool but a *writing* tool, enabling novel connections between thoughts as opposed to the referential role of a library catalogue.\n\n1950s German sociologist Niklas Luhmann is commonly cited as relying heavily on his own zettelkasten in the production of his prolific writing. Where Luhmann‚Äôs contribution to the system lies is in his use of numbers, letters, slashes, and commas to refer to individual notes‚Äô positions within the larger system ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)). This approach allows notes‚Äô labels to be endlessly expansive, meaning that Luhmann could organize them contextually and always knew their location within his ever-expanding information system. Further, since these labels did not shift as new notes were added to the system, he could also reference existing notes in different areas of the system. Through this ever-expanding reference system, Luhmann created a web of knowledge which ‚Äúvery much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet‚Äù ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md), p. 24))‚Äîan anachronistic analogy which brought Daniel L√ºdecke to develop a free software in 2015, titled Zettelkasten, which digitizes Luhmann‚Äôs process. Rather than cards in a slip box, these notes are now housed in the binary code of the hard drive.\n\nThis attention to digital note-taking has spurred the creation of a loosely-termed ‚ÄúPKM‚Äù (Personal Knowledge Management) scene online. The PKM community is rich for its experimentation and openness to knowledge sharing, and I owe much of my thinking on networked note structures to the many individuals contributing to digital note-taking methods and methodologies. There are [YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanJenksTech), [forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/), and [blogs](https://pkmjournal.com) dedicated to not just taking notes, but to developing and maintaining note-taking systems (e.g., [Dubois, n.d.](References/Dubois,%20nd.md); \\[\\[Jenks, nd|Jenks \\[@BryanJenksTech\\], n.d.\\]\\]; [r/PKMS, n.d.](References/r%20PKMS,%20nd.md)). In these spaces, professionals, students, and academics exchange methodological principles for note-taking, experiment with new note-taking software, and sometimes even contribute the creation of such software if they are free and open source.\n\nIn its emphasis on note-taking strategies, however, PKM tends to focus on individual productivity as the ultimate measure of a note-taking system rather than any consideration of the types of knowledge these systems might help produce. For example, the fact that Luhmann wrote over 50 books and over 500 journal articles in his 30-year career using his note-taking system is often cited in PKM spaces ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)) but there are few if any discussions about Luhmann‚Äôs qualitative contributions to his field. The tendency for PKM to glorify productivity via technological means echoes the way digital technologies are largely shaped by neoliberal narratives which treat the internet as a space of profound egalitarianism, despite the dependency of contemporary communications infrastructure on global racial capitalism ([Noble, 2016](References/Noble,%202016.md)). While the free and open source software developed by members of the PKM community is helpful for many, little has been theorized about who and what these systems can be useful *for* outside of a general appeal for neoliberal productivity.\n\nThis is not to say that there is no opportunity for feminist interventions into digital note-taking technologies, however. Describing how database organization is critical to the access and distribution as well as autonomy and privacy of the information it contains, Communication Studies scholar [Cait McKinney (2020)](References/McKinney,%202020.md) outlines a history of feminist \"information activism\": \n\n \u003e \n \u003e This concept brings together people, their visions of justice, and the media they use to organize, store, and provide access to information, a relationship that is key to understanding feminism‚Äôs role in histories of commonplace technologies such as computer databases. (p. 2)\n\nInspired by this history, I see an opportunity to bring a vision of social justice to the networked note organization strategies emerging from PKM. These strategies offer alternatives to the critiques launched against folders and files, bringing notes out of artificially imposed hierarchies and into an always-relational network to bridge disciplines and integrate situated knowledges in a variety of media forms.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Notes as constructions of knowledge](pa4%20Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) | [üìñ Four nodes of a feminist note-taking methodology üëâ](pa6%20Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.316741142Z","tags":[]},"/pa6-Four-nodes-of-a-feminist-note-taking-methodology":{"title":"üìñ Four nodes of a feminist note-taking methodology","content":"\nConsidering the varying conceptualizations of notes as representations, constructions, and structures of knowledge in relation to feminist epistemological concerns,  I [return to my original question](pa2%20Introduction.md): How can we take notes committed to producing socially just knowledges? In the remainder of this essay, I name four brief concepts foundational to a feminist note-taking methodology. I call these nodes to reflect their relationality, as no one concept is more important than the other. They are all required to work together to establish a feminist note network.\n\nWhile it is possible to enact this system using analog means (as Luhmann and Moser demonstrate), I use digital technologies to enact this system. This includes writing notes in Markdown, a human-readable language which enables heading structures and basic text formatting like italics, bold, links, and blockquotes. Critically, Markdown enables not just hyperlinks to outside resources but also links between other Markdown files.[^1]\n\nWhile Markdown is human readable, it requires software to render its links and formatting. Consider software a window through which notes written in Markdown can be read, edited, interacted with, and navigated between. The software I use for note-taking and is subsequently used in my visual examples is called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a robust, local, and free software which renders Markdown. One especially useful aspect of Obsidian is the ability to render a list or graph of all files which link to another. This allows the user to navigate both forward and backward through their linked notes. In my eyes, however, the primary advantage of Obsidian is that the files it renders are entirely local. This means that Obsidian requires no internet connection and is therefore much more reliable and secure than cloud-based note-taking systems.

This section presents four brief principles which inform by own feminist note-taking methodology. Although these principles are necessarily listed in a chosen order, no one principle is more important than the other. They are all required to work together to establish a feminist note network.\n\nI also include some rudimentary technical explanations as to how to enact these principles. This includes writing notes in a language called Markdown, a human readable language which enables heading structures and basic text formatting like italics, bold, links, and blockquotes. Critically, Markdown enables not just hyperlinks to outside resources but also links between files. For details on Markdown syntax, I highly recommend visiting [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) ([Cone, 2022](References/Cone,%202022.md)).\n\nWhile Markdown is human readable, it requires software to render its links and formatting. Users can, however, easily change between software, making Markdown relatively future-proof. The software I use and recommend for note-taking is called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a robust, local, and free software which renders Markdown. Consider software a window through which notes written in Markdown can be read, edited, interacted with, and navigated between. One especially useful aspect of Obsidian is the ability to render a list of all files which link to another. This allows the user to navigate both forward and backward through their links. The primary advantage of Obsidian, however, is that the files it renders are entirely local, meaning that Obsidian requires no internet connection and is entirely secure. Obsidian is used by a significant portion of the PKM community and has a multitude of community-made plugins which can adapt the software to fit individual needs. I also highly recommend visiting both Obsidian's [official documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index) ([Obsidianmd, nd](References/Obsidianmd,%20nd.md)) and checking out Obsidian-specific PKM community resources.

Another downside are the impacts of folder hierarchies on knowledge production, a concern explored above: The context that containers provide necessarily informs the meaning of the notes they hold. A note filed under one course code or field, for example, will always be understood in relation to that course or field, and the other notes generated from the course or field.

Regularly reviewing notes and their connections is a useful way to ensure they meet our research needs, with the added benefit of bringing older notes back to mind to develop future connections.\n\n[^2]: Although Obsidian renders local Markdown files, saving these files on cloud storage allows others to contribute to the note-taking system as if they were also local on their own machines.

Most methodological approaches to note-taking, however, focus on the [representational](pa3%20Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) or [constitutive](pa4%20Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) role of individual notes in the knowledges they produce. And while some analyses of institutional knowledge management critique a lack of attention to the always-present power dynamics of file organization ([Gitelman, 2014](References/Gitelman,%202014.md); [Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md); [Vismann, 2008](References/Vismann,%202008.md)), these critiques have not been explored in relation to personal note-taking methods. The growing PKM community, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of [structure](pa5%20Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) in the production of knowledge via notes ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)), but tends to avoid considering who these knowledges serve or thinking critically about the types of neoliberal subjects their rhetoric produces. Alongside these explorations of the role of notes and files in knowledge production, feminist theorists continue to urge that we critically consider how hegemonic power structures shape what knowledges are knowable by whom ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md); [Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md); [Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)), their accepted validity ([Hill Collins, 1989](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md)), and who benefits from them ([TallBear, 2014](References/TallBear,%202014.md)). \n\nBringing these bodies of work together, we can see that establishing a note-taking practice is one space where feminist practices can be enacted in the effort to produce more socially just research. My feminist note-taking methodology is my own effort to do so, using [atomicity](pa6a%20Atomicity.md), [flatness](pa6b%20Flatness.md), [interconnection](pa6c%20Interconnection.md), and [iteration](pa6d%20Iteration.md) to finding novel connections between unexpected sources. to find novel connections between unexpected sources. It is no small feat to adopt a new note-taking system. Not only does this approach encourage rethinking exactly what a note should be, but it also requires getting to know new software. This is compounded further by the way that a network of notes relies on note volume as well as to note quality. Reaching this critical mass can be daunting, but is incredibly rewarding: As the volume of notes grows, new patterns emerge which would have been easily overlooked otherwise‚Äîand once recognized, these patterns become easy motivators to continue maintaining a note-taking system, rewarding not just for the new ideas they can bring to light but also their potential to challenge the status quo of institutional knowledge production and support underrepresented voices.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà üìñ Four nodes of a feminist note-taking methodology](pa6%20Four%20nodes%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) | [üìñ Works cited  üëâ](Works%20cited.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-29T02:02:23.316741142Z","tags":[]},"/pr1-Note-taking-as-an-interdisciplinary-feminist-method":{"title":"üìΩÔ∏è Developing a feminist note-taking system","content":"\n*An exploration of everyday academic methods*\n\n[Kit Chokly](https://kitchokly.com), PhD Student in Communication Studies, McGill University\nCanadian Communication Association Conference, June 1, 2023\n\n## Following along at [rb.gy/294ym](https://rb.gy/294ym)\n\nOr scan this code:\n\n![QR code linking to this site](QRCode.png)\n\nLinks with this üìñ icon connect to the relevant section of the original paper, which can [üìñ read from the beginning here](pa1%20table%20of%20contents.md).\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e Next: [üìΩÔ∏è The milk crate problem](pr2%20The%20milk%20crate%20problem.md)\n\n---\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!quote\\]- Transcript\n \u003e \n \u003e Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Kit.

I had been meticulous in my note-*taking*, and this had served me quite well in my classes and research at the time.

And this doesn‚Äôt even consider the many half-baked ideas I have jotted on post-its or typed into Word files and note-taking apps over the years. There was evidently a disconnect between taking these notes and using them as I moved forward into new projects‚Äîa problem that seemed especially poignant as I was starting a PhD.\n \u003e \n \u003e So I started looking into academic note-taking and retrieval practices. And despite the growing genre of academic ‚Äúself-help‚Äù books, I didn‚Äôt find much on note-taking besides what I had already been doing. Most of the literature was aimed at students stressing the importance of note-taking in the first place. There were some paper-vs-digital debates‚Äîfascinating to analyse from a media studies perspective, but not what I was after here‚Äîand several articles describing the importance of accuracy and representation in note-taking as a part of other methods, like ethnographies or interviews. But none of these approaches talked about the long-term storage and retrieval of personal notes, and no one else seemed to share my problem with moving notes from the context of where I wrote them into new ones.Much methodological writing about note-taking within academic work focuses on its role in other research methods, especially in concert with methods like ethnography or interviews.

PKM is a variety of systematic approaches to, well, managing one‚Äôs own knowledge: the stacks of paper like those found in my milk crates, but also those found across various media types, reflections from one‚Äôs own journals, and even notes on conversations with others.\n \u003e \n \u003e PKM can be quite broad, but it‚Äôs primary focus is on what I called networked note-taking systems. These systems don‚Äôt just focus on the techniques used to *take* notes, but also their storage structure and the way this structure works to *resurface these notes* into new contexts.\n \u003e \n \u003e Usually, notes are organized by the context or date that they were \\_taken‚Äî\\_filed into a documents folder or notebook tabbed by subject‚Äîbut not necessarily when they will be *used.* Even with digital search tools, this still means that notes are resurfaced purposefully: for search to work, you have to remember that something within this note exists so you can start looking for it. *In addition to harnessing search*, networked note-taking systems are designed to resurface relevant notes not just when you already remember they‚Äôre already there, but also when you don‚Äôt‚Äîallowing for new and unexpected connections to be made across contexts and fields, effectively using notes to *produce new knowledges*.\n \u003e \n \u003e This usually involves a centralized database which holds these notes and links them together by relevance, creating a network of personal knowledge. Many of the conversations in PKM spaces pop up around the tools used to make this network. Some stick to pen-and-paper methods, often inspired by the index card ‚Äúzettelkasten‚Äù system used by 20th century German sociologist Niklas Luhmann which followed similar principles.

But knowledge production is a foundational concern for feminist scholars, as feminist epistemology emerges by recognizing and challenging the way that structures of power like patriarchy, white supremacy, ableism, and cisheteronormativity are baked into the knowledges largely taken as objectively true in institutional spaces.\n \u003e \n \u003e As [Patricia Hill Collins (1989)](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md) argues, the racist and sexist exclusion of Black women from education, literacy, and jobs means their perspectives have been largely omitted from the processes of knowledge validation. This creates a teleological argument where the dominant group is convinced of both Black and female intellectual inferiority because of their absence that *this dominant group enforced in the first place.*\n \u003e \n \u003e In response, feminists have pushed to legitimate experiential and embodied knowledges in institutional spaces of knowledge production and validation, developing and adding on to theoretical frameworks like standpoint ([Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)) and sitpoint theories ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md)) and the idea of situated knowledges ([Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md))‚Äîeach of which varyingly stresses the importance of intersectional, embodied positionality in knowledge production.\n \u003e \n \u003e These theories rest on the notion that research and researchers, like all aspects of¬†knowledge production, are always already entangled ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md)).
