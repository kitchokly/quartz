This section presents four brief principles I have developed which inform by own feminist note-taking methodology. Although these principles are necessarily listed in a chosen order, no one principle is more important than the other. They are all required to work together to establish a feminist note network.\n\nI also include some rudimentary technical explanations as to how to enact these principles. This includes writing notes in a language called Markdown, a human readable language which enables heading structures and basic text formatting like italics, bold, links, and blockquotes. Critically, Markdown enables not just hyperlinks to outside resources but also links between files. For details on Markdown syntax, I highly recommend visiting [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) ([Cone, 2022](References/Cone,%202022.md)).\n\nWhile Markdown is human readable, it requires software to render its links and formatting. Users can, however, easily change between software, making Markdown relatively future-proof. The software I use and recommend for note-taking is called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian is a robust, local, and free software which renders Markdown. Consider software a window through which notes written in Markdown can be read, edited, interacted with, and navigated between. One especially useful aspect of Obsidian is the ability to render a list of all files which link to another. This allows the user to navigate both forward and backward through their links. The primary advantage of Obsidian, however, is that the files it renders are entirely local, meaning that Obsidian requires no internet connection and is entirely secure. Obsidian is used by a significant portion of the PKM community and has a multitude of community-made plugins which can adapt the software to fit individual needs. I also highly recommend visiting both Obsidian's [official documentation](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index) ([Obsidianmd, nd](References/Obsidianmd,%20nd.md)) and checking out Obsidian-specific PKM community resources. Obsidian's [YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@obsdmd/playlists) of various community video walkthroughs of the software ([Obsidian, nd](References/Obsidian,%20nd.md)), the [Obsidian subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/obsidianmd) ([r ObsidianMD, nd](References/r%20ObsidianMD,%20nd.md)); and the [Obsidian Roundup newsletter](https://www.reddit.com/r/obsidianmd) ([Konik, nd](References/Konik,%20nd.md)) are good places get started.\n\nThese principles draw on strategies outlined by a number of thinkers in PKM, many of whom offer their own principles and guides to note-taking. Importantly, however, there is no distinctly \"right way\" of to take notes: Note-taking systems are unique to the individual(s) writing and reading these notes, their intended uses, and the underlying technologies available. Feminist perspectives on methods echo this notion, stressing the importance of context and social location on research processes ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md)). These methods are no exception. I hope, however, that it can encourage other students and researchers to critically examine the impacts of their own note-taking practices on their work, and perhaps inspire the development of additional note-taking methodologies which hold social justice at their core‚Äîproducing new and varying methods I hope will also be shared with others.\n\n## The four principles\n\n1.

This banality positions note-taking as practice requiring little explanation: We read something, attend a lecture, or make a research observation, and then commit it to paper (digital or otherwise), storing it for retrieval at a later date (or not). As @MarinSturm2021 point out, note-taking is largely considered a mechanical process at best and boring and ineffective at worst. But to take note is to quite literally define what is considered notable, and, by extension, what is not ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md)). These noted observations then become evidence for the claims we make. Notes may not be frequently discussed, but they are part of the very foundation of the institutional production knowledge. \n\nBound up with my own frustration with note-taking as a graduate student in the overlapping space of social sciences and humanities, I use this paper to position [notes as critical to the construction of academic knowledge](Paper/Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) and thus one useful space for feminist methodological intervention. To do so, I explore the [contemporary academic literature on note-taking](Paper/Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) as well as the [contributions of the Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) online community](Paper/Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) and situate them in relation to feminist concepts of knowledge production. I then consider how notes and their organization can be used support the production of interdisciplinary and justice-oriented knowledges, outlining [four principles which shape my own feminist note-taking methodology](Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) as well as their technical enactment via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), a free software I use to render my notes. \n\nWhile some attention has been made to emphasize the importance of producing accurate and representational notes‚Äîsometimes offering practical tips to inform note-taking practices‚Äîthere is little discussion about what to do with these notes once they have been produced. This gap has consequences, as the knowledge a note produces is always also informed by its contextual relationships, including its location and its relationship to other notes and ideas. Organizing notes into particular themes, sources, and categories via folders, notebooks, and boxes inform what kind of claims can be made with them in the first place, often siloing particular information from others. Notebooks or digital Documents folders‚Äîshared or private‚Äîare thus similar to institutional archives in that they are always tied up with power: They inform what is worth knowing and shape how it can be known ([Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md)). **How can we take notes to serve a commitment to producing socially just knowledges? What do we choose what to include in these notes? And how should we organize them, especially in the virtually endless storage capacities of digital systems today?** \n\nAlthough notes are rarely framed within the context of social justice, they can inform the collection, synthesis, and retrieval of knowledge, especially in research contexts. This makes note-taking foundational to academic knowledge production and thus worth considering critically in our everyday work. Developing a feminist note-taking system, I argue, presents one ordinary space where new paths can potentially emerge which challenge the \"default setting\" of academia towards more socially just ends ([Ahmed, 2019](References/Ahmed,%202019.md), p. 160). \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üè† Table of Contents](Developing%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20system.md) | [Notes as representations of knowledge üëâ](Paper/Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Paper/Notes-as-constructions-of-knowledge":{"title":"Notes as constructions of knowledge","content":"\nAn exception to the concern for note accuracy stems from approaches which recognize the constitutive rather than representational role note-taking plays in the production of knowledge. As a form of writing, note-taking is an inherently creative act, always involving thought rather than simply representing it ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md)). This suggests that representational accuracy should not be the sole goal for good note-taking as it ignores the role of the researcher in their observations and the knowledges they produce ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md)). \n\nThis assertion follows the central claims of feminist thought which challenges the notion of objective knowledge. Feminist theorists have long been concerned with the relationship between ontology and epistemology; that is, how the people producing knowledge come to inform these knowledges ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md); [Hemmings, 2015](References/Hemmings,%202015.md); [TallBear, 2014](References/TallBear,%202014.md)). For example, [Hill Collins (1989)](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md) argues that the exclusion of Black women from education, literacy, and jobs has led to tendency of white men to control the process of knowledge validation. This contributes to a teleological argument where the dominant group is convinced of *both* Black and female intellectual inferiority, suppressing the legitimacy of Black feminist in institutional spaces. In response, feminists have pushed to legitimate experiential and embodied knowledges in institutional spaces, developing theoretical frameworks like standpoint theory ([Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)), sitpoint theory ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md)), situated knowledges ([Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md)) which all stress the importance of intersectional positionality in the production of knowledge. \n\nResearch and researchers, like all aspects of¬†knowledge production, are always already entangled ([Gunaratnam \u0026 Hamilton, 2017](References/Gunaratnam%20\u0026%20Hamilton,%202017.md)). Method is thus inseparable from both the research problem and the researcher, shaping questions, problems, and solutions in its enactment. Good research well involves acknowledging these messy entanglements and multiplicities, reckoning with our own¬†situated knowledges as well as the knowledges of those around us. Reflecting on the always situated nature of writing, [Gibbs (2007)](References/Gibbs,%202007.md) thus argues that writing is \"a mode of inquiry in its own right\" (p. 222) which does not just *support* various research methods but should actually be framed as *a method in itself*. This makes writing notes a methodological process:\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Writing, then, cannot be a methodological ‚Äòtool‚Äô in any simple sense. It is, rather, a process, implicitly dialogical, in conversation with the world, with other writing, and, reflexively, with itself. It is this very means of procedure ‚Äì a turning and returning ‚Äì that characterizes it as an affective methodology. ([Gibbs, 2007](References/Gibbs,%202007.md), p.  224)\n\nBy focusing on writing notes as not just a tool but a method which always involves the writer as a part of what is written, Gibbs emphasizes research as a creative rather than descriptive process. This shifts the emphasis of notes as a support for research into a direct form of research, a shift which is reflected in work attuned to feminist values. Is not uncommon to now find research which includes vignettes of personal field notes, journals, and even poetry stemming from a variety of fields and research topics (e.g., [Stewart, 2007](References/Stewart,%202007.md). [Stryker, 1994](References/Stryker,%201994.md). and [Van Wyck, 2010](References/Van%20Wyck,%202010.md). These works bring the situated knowledge of the researcher into their research, legitimizing lived experience as a valuable form of academic inquiry and thus contributing to the growing diversity in institutional knowledge production.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà Notes as representations of knowledge](Paper/Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) | [Notes as structures of knowledge üëâ](Paper/Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Paper/Notes-as-representations-of-knowledge":{"title":"Notes as representations of knowledge","content":"\nMost of the literature on note-taking focuses on writing individual notes on a particular topic, usually with an emphasis on their use as memory aids. In Europe, [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that note-taking to support long-term memory emerged in the Renaissance, where notes were often collected, reviewed, and shared with others. The emphasis on sharing and collaboration and the genre of reference books which emerged from these practices shifted note-taking methods to become a generally standardized in the early modern era ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). This includes not just the content of notes but also their organization, as the collection of many-authored notes requires clear headings and the use of finding devices to locate any particular information ([Blair, 2010](References/Blair,%202010.md)). Note-taking was largely considered a research tool, however, and students in early universities largely did not take notes in lecture contexts ([Clark, 2008](References/Clark,%202008.md); [Marin \u0026 Sturm, 2021](References/Marin%20\u0026%20Sturm,%202021.md)). \n\nToday, note-taking has become an encouraged practiced for students, although [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) argues that note-taking has become \"more idiosyncratic to each note-taker\" (p. 63). This is supported by some research on student note-taking which suggests a lack of systemic note-taking practices among post-secondary students ([Morehead et al, 2019](References/Morehead%20et%20al,%202019.md)). Further research strives to remedy this issue by offering practical tips note-takers can apply to their own practices, which includes a sub-genre of instructional guides aimed at students (see [Broadwater (2003)](References/Broadwater,%202003.md), [Rohde (2013)](References/Rohde,%202013.md), and [Perry et al. (2018)](References/Perry%20et%20al,%202018.md). The most common assertion, however, is that taking good notes is not necessarily about being systematic but most importantly about properly representing that which is being noted ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md); [Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)).\n\nThis emphasis on representational accuracy is important. As [Gimenez \u0026 Patel (2013)](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md)argue, notes represent what the researcher observes as relevant about an object of study and are used to inform subsequent analysis of that object once it is no longer within view. The recognition that notes are always limited by the researcher's interpretation of an event or object of study and their ability to represent it on paper brings this general body of literature to ask how the researcher determines what is or is not relevant to ensure note accuracy. Some respond to this issue by suggesting we introduce visual, audio, and audiovisual media to capture information without requiring the researcher to discern what is or is not noteworthy in the moment ([Tinny \u0026 Nhamo, 2013](References/Tinny%20\u0026%20Nhamo,%202013.md)). Others suggest using templates to help note-takers to consider overlooked types of information and thus increase the representativeness of their data ([Gimenez \u0026 Pinel, 2013](References/Gimenez%20\u0026%20Pinel,%202013.md))\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà Introduction](Paper/Introduction.md) | [Notes as constructions of knowledge üëâ](Paper/Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Paper/Notes-as-structures-of-knowledge":{"title":"Notes as structures of knowledge","content":"\nWhether understood as materializations of memory or the process of situated thought itself, notes do not stand alone: They are always in relation to other thoughts, ideas, and observations. These relationships are always shaped by power, meaning that feminist note-taking must go beyond the contemporary emphasis on note contents to consider the broader system which places notes in context with each other and structures their retrieval.\n\nFor example, Institutions such as museums, libraries, and archives use organizing tools and techniques such as collections, databases, lists, maps, catalogues, and indexes all contribute the meaning of their written contents. Archives do not simply document the past: They actively shape the construction of the past‚Äîof cultural memory‚Äîby the way they store and present different forms of information ([Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md)). The placement of one record next to another offers evidence of a shared context and begins to piece together a story which is as much formed by what is present, where, as what is not present at all. Rather than offering a guide to finding pearls of meaning, the organization of this information is part of the very production of such knowledge‚Äîbe it within the fonds of an archive or the Documents folder on a personal computer.[^1]\n\nAs an alternative to taken-for-granted folder structures, [Ahrens (2017)](References/Ahrens,%202017.md) emphasizes the need for notes to relate to each other for them to be useful. This is not a new concept: Historical studies of early modern European scribal practices emphasize the role of organization over content, turning to indexes, topic-specific notebooks, and even cabinets of keyword slips as solutions to finding information amongst the vastness of one's notes (see [Blair (2010)](References/Blair,%202010.md) and [Soll, 2010](References/Soll,%202010.md)). In comparison, however, most contemporary literature on note-taking takes their organization as a given, perhaps due to the reliance of computers on deep folder structures and the availability of keyword searches, tagging, and flexible file ordering. This organization tools are undoubtably useful for note organization. Still, the lack of attention to the need to clearly connect notes prevents cross-fertilization of ideas between subjects, disciplines, sources, and moments.\n\n[Ahrens (2017)](References/Ahrens,%202017.md) points to the note-taking methods of 1950s German sociologist Niklas Luhmann as a source of inspiration for his own note organization system. Luhmann kept what he called a zettelkasten, a slip box full of index cards where he wrote all of his notes. Rather than organizing these cards by topic or source, Luhmann would organize them by a series of numbers, letters, slashes, and commas which referred to their position within the larger system ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)). For example, a note which fell under a broader topic labelled with the number 42 might be labelled as 42/1a and place directly underneath it in the slip box. A second note directly related to 42/1a may be listed as 42/1b and added to the slip box following it. By allowing his notes' labels to be endlessly expansive, Luhmann could organize them contextually and always knew their location within his ever-expanding information system. Further, since these labels did not shift as new notes were added to the system, he could also reference existing notes in different areas of the system, creating a web of knowledge which Ahrens describes as resembling an analog version of the hyperlinked internet.\n\nThe similar affordances between Luhmann's note organization system and the internet has brought a number of efforts to replicate his system using digital means. In fact, an entire online community has emerged surrounding networked note-taking today, although academic literature has yet to recognize their contributions. Loosely organized under the broader term \"PKM\" or Personal Knowledge Management, there are [YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/c/BryanJenksTech) ([Jenks, nd](References/Jenks,%20nd.md)), [forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/PKMS/) ([r PKMS, nd](References/r%20PKMS,%20nd.md)), and [blogs](https://pkmjournal.com) ([Dubois, nd](References/Dubois,%20nd.md)) dedicated to developing and maintaining networked note-taking systems like Luhmann's. In these spaces, professionals, students, and academics exchange methodological principles for note-taking, experiment with new note-taking software, and often contribute the creation of such software, which are often free and open source. The PKM community is rich for its experimentation and openness to sharing knowledge and software, and I owe much of my thinking on networked note structures to the many individuals contributing to digital note-taking methods and methodologies. \n\nIn its emphasis on note-taking strategies, however, PKM tends to focus on individual productivity as the ultimate measure of a note-taking system rather than any consideration of the types of knowledge these systems might help produce. For example, the fact that Luhmann wrote over 50 books and over 500 journal articles in his 30-year career using his note-taking system ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)) is often cited in PKM spaces, but there are few if any discussions about Luhmann's qualitative contributions to his field. The tendency for PKM to glorify productivity via technological means echoes the way digital technologies are largely shaped by neoliberal narratives which treat the internet as a space of profound egalitarianism, despite the dependency of contemporary communications infrastructure on global racial capitalism ([Noble, 2016](References/Noble,%202016.md)). While the free and open source software developed by members of the PKM community is helpful for many, little has been theorized about who and what these systems can be useful *for* outside of a general appeal for neoliberal productivity.\n\nThis is not to say that there is no opportunity for feminist interventions into media technologies. Describing how database organization is critical to the access and distribution as well as autonomy and privacy of the information it contains, [McKinney (2020)](References/McKinney,%202020.md) outlines a history of feminist \"information activism\": \n\n \u003e \n \u003e This concept brings together people, their visions of justice, and the media they use to organize, store, and provide access to information, a relationship that is key to understanding feminism‚Äôs role in histories of commonplace technologies such as computer databases. (p. 2)\n\nInspired by this history, I see an opportunity to bring a vision of social justice to the networked note organization strategies emerging from PKM. These strategies offer alternatives to the critiques launched against folders and files, bringing notes out of artificially imposed hierarchies and into an always-relational network to bridge disciplines and integrate situated knowledges in a variety of media forms. \n\n[^1]: For more on the social construction of files, see [Vismann's (2008)](References/Vismann,%202008.md) investigation into the co-construction of files and the law and [Gitelman's (2014)](References/Gitelman,%202014.md) media history of documents.\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà Notes as constructions of knowledge](Paper/Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) | [Four principles of a feminist note-taking methodology üëâ](Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Paper/On-format":{"title":"On format","content":"\nThe strength of a feminist note-taking system, as [I will come to argue](Paper/Introduction.md), is its networked qualities‚Äîa strength that is not necessarily shared with essays or linear arguements.

Most methodological approaches to note-taking, however, focus on the [representational](Paper/Notes%20as%20representations%20of%20knowledge.md) or [constitutive](Paper/Notes%20as%20constructions%20of%20knowledge.md) role of individual notes in the knowledges they produce. And while some analyses of institutional knowledge management critique a lack of attention to the always-present power dynamics of file organization ([Gitelman, 2014](References/Gitelman,%202014.md); [Schwartz \u0026 Cook, 2002](References/Schwartz%20\u0026%20Cook,%202002.md); [Vismann, 2008](References/Vismann,%202008.md)), these critiques have not been explored in relation to personal note-taking. The growing PKM community, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of [structure](Paper/Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) in the production of knowledge via notes ([Ahrens, 2017](References/Ahrens,%202017.md)), but tends to avoid considering who these knowledges serve. \n\nAlongside these explorations of the role of notes and files in knowledge production, feminist theorists continue to urge that we critically consider how hegemonic power structures shape what knowledges are knowable by whom ([Garland-Thomson, 2002](References/Garland-Thomson,%202002.md)l [Haraway, 1988](References/Haraway,%201988.md); [Hartsock, 1985](References/Hartsock,%201985.md)), their accepted validity ([Hill Collins, 1989](References/Hill%20Collins,%201989.md)), and who they come to serve ([TallBear, 2014](References/TallBear,%202014.md)). Bringing these bodies of work together, we can see that establishing a note-taking practice is one space where feminist practices can be enacted in the effort to produce more socially just research. My feminist note-taking methodology is my own effort to do so, using principles of [atomicity](Paper/Principle%20of%20atomicity.md), [flatness](Paper/Principle%20of%20flatness.md), [interconnection](Paper/Principle%20of%20interconnection.md), and [iteration](Paper/Principle%20of%20iteration.md) to finding novel connections between unexpected sources. \n\nIt is no small feat to adopt a new note-taking system. Not only does this approach encourage rethinking exactly what a note should be, but it also requires getting to know new software. This is compounded further by the way that a network of notes relies on note volume as well as to note quality. Reaching this critical mass can be daunting, but is incredibly rewarding: As the volume of notes grows, new patterns emerge which would have been easily overlooked otherwise‚Äîand once recognized, these patterns become easy motivators to continue maintaining your note-taking system, rewarding not just for the new ideas they can bring to light but also their potential to challenge the status quo of institutional knowledge production and support underrepresented voices. \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà Four principles of a feminist note-taking methodology](Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md) | [Works cited  üëâ](Works%20cited.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Paper/Principle-of-atomicity":{"title":"Principle of atomicity","content":"\n## Write notes to include only one idea\n\nEstablishing a networked note-taking system requires reconceptualizing what makes up a note. Primarily, we are concerned here with notes which contain ideas: Notes on other types of information such as biographical data or shopping lists are not necessarily the most useful within the network (although biographical data can be usefully linked to particular ideas as a form of citation, as this digital paper strives to demonstrate). Critically, however, these ideas can and should come from a variety of sources. Taking note of the ideas we encounter in our day-to-day life, not just academic literature, is an important way to diversify the knowledges we produce.\n\nWorking with ideas is where the strength of the network happens. Unlike traditional idea-notes where one note is meant to capture the entire context of a reading, lecture, or observation session, however, [networked note-taking](Paper/Notes%20as%20structures%20of%20knowledge.md) relies on other notes for context. This means that individual notes are much shorter than traditional notes and are meant to capture one clear idea, or what [Tietze (2013)](References/Tietze,%202013.md) describes as the principle of atomicity, where the note-taker must keep relevant notes close together, but ultimately \"separate concerns from one another\"‚Äîa concept which he derives from software engineering (para. 24). [Matuschak (n.d.-b)](References/Matuschak,%20nd-b.md) adds that atomicity is useful because it makes connections across notes much more specific.\n\nThis principle can be difficult to enact because it requires drawing boundaries around what makes up a complete idea, a concept which has blurry boundaries to begin with. Overly-atomized notes do not stand on their own and require too much traversing across the system to understand, while notes which are not atomized enough are difficult to link to others.

A folder, notebook, drawer, or box all act as containers for similar notes, the common thread between them defined by the filing system. These categories are usually determined by either the notes' intended use or the context of its collection: Students may label these containers temporally and thematically by course and/or semester, for example, and researchers often use labels informed by a topic, field, theme, or project. \n\nCategory containers like these are quite useful in that they divide large volumes of files into smaller, contextual groups, making them much easier to find. One practical downside with containers is that they do not scale. Too many files in one folder may not only be physically unwieldy, but it quickly returns us to the original problem of having too large of a volume of files to give any of them context or even be findable without a robust search tool. Another downside are the impacts of folder hierarchies on knowledge production, a concern explored above: The context that containers provide necessarily informs the meaning of the notes they hold. A note filed under one course code or field, for example, will always be understood in relation to that course or field, and the other notes generated from the course or field. This prevents the cross-fertilization of ideas across the boundaries by which they are filed, meaning not only that it is more difficult to generate new ideas from your notes, but that you also risk duplicating work you have already done, just in a different context.\n\nPutting notes in one container may seem to risk losing them in a disorganized mess, especially when following the principle of atomicity which increases the volume of notes. However, using a digital system means that search and metadata filtering and ordering such as file name, data added, date modified, and file type can be useful to track down specific notes. Most importantly, the principle of flatness works around the siloing of notes into externally imposed categories. Flattening instead encourages ideas to find new context amongst themselves, enabling the generation of new and unexpected ideas, leading us to the [principle of interconnection](Paper/Principle%20of%20interconnection.md). \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà Four principles overview](Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e 1.

This means linking notes liberally to create flexible and perhaps even novel contexts for ideas and concepts. As [Matuschak (n.d.-c)](References/Matuschak,%20nd-c.md) writes, \"If we push ourselves to add lots of links between our notes, that makes us think expansively about what other concepts might be related to what we‚Äôre thinking about\" (para. 1). Not only does this mean our notes become non-hierarchical and non-linear, but it also enables a profound creativity in our writing which can lead us to unexpected places for research. This creativity critical for social justice-oriented research. As [TallBear (2014)](References/TallBear,%202014.md) argues:\n\n \u003e \n \u003e It is also helpful to think creatively about the research process as a relationship-building process, as a professional networking process with colleagues (not ‚Äúsubjects‚Äù), as an opportunity for conversation and sharing of knowledge, not simply data gathering. Research must then be conceived in less linear ways without necessarily knowable goals at the outset. (p. 2)\n\nHere, TallBear is referring to the relations of researchers and other people involved in research, but as [Gibbs (2007)](References/Gibbs,%202007.md) argues, relationships can manifest in our notes, too. Notes are not just for recording observations from the field and literature reviews but also for recording interesting conversations and other nontraditional sources of knowledge. Linking these notes together introduces the validity institutional knowledge requires  with the multitude of knowledges it frequent excludes.\n\nThe foundation of Luhmann's system involved finding ways to link notes via analog mean. Markdown, however, is a language which formats plan text and enables linking between files. Simply encasing a text string within square brackets transforms it into a link to any other note within the container which shares the string as its title. This allows us to make a link to another idea within a sentence, much like the links on Wikipedia. \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e [üëà Four principles overview](Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e 1.

Notes in a networked note-taking system are living ideas, and should be reviewed periodically to ensure they still fit your needs.\n\nThe liveliness of notes and the need to maintain them brings a number of PKM contributors to use gardening metaphors to describe their networked note-taking systems (see [Ang (2021)](References/Ang,%202021.md) and [Matuschak (n.d.-a)](References/Matuschak,%20nd-a.md)). I hesitate with the naturalization of knowledge some of these metaphors imply, which risk ignoring that knowledge as always socially produced and situated. They do, however, usefully demonstrate the value of tending to your note-taking system. The system should serve its user(s),[^2] and if it becomes unwieldy, it should be adapted. Often, PKM community members have already developed solutions to particular issues‚Äî[Milo (n.d.)](References/Milo,%20nd.md), for example, suggests creating specific \"Map of Content\" notes which contain no ideas but simply lists related notes to view them all from a macro perspective.

Regularly reviewing notes and their connections is a useful way to ensure they meet our research needs, with the added benefit of bringing older notes back to mind to develop future connections.\n\n[^2]: Although Obsidian renders local Markdown files, saving these files on cloud storage allows others to contribute to the note-taking system as if they were also local on their own machines.

Regularly reviewing notes and their connections is a useful way to make sure that they meet our research needs, with the added benefit of bringing older notes back to mind to develop future connections.\n\n[üìñ](../Paper/Principle%20of%20iteration.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Presentation/Networked-note-taking":{"title":"Networked note-taking","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Finding ways to make connections within and between the variety of notes we take, where these connections actually contribute to producing knowledge beyond the sum of individual notes.\n\n* Growing online community and increasing number of software options\n* Networked note-taking is not technologically determined\n  * Records of networked note-taking systems dating back to the 18th century\n  * Even books are not as linear as we think!\n\n![Screenshot 2023-04-12 at 14.10.15.png](../Screenshot%202023-04-12%20at%2014.10.15.png)\n*A codex from the second half of the 13th century including text, commentary, and other marginalia.

Networked note-taking means finding ways to make connections within and between the variety of notes we take, where these connections actually contribute to producing knowledge beyond the sum total of individual notes.\n \u003e \n \u003e There‚Äôs a growing community of networked note-taking enthusiasts appearing online right now, with many debates about the many apps and platforms available today to support such a system.\n \u003e \n \u003e As a media studies scholar, it‚Äôs important for me to emphasize that networked note-taking is not a method which only emerged with the invention of digital hyperlinks like I‚Äôm using now. Scholars have actually been using tools like index cards with unique reference IDs to make links across their notes since at least the 18th century. And as Johanna Drucker reminds us, books have always been nonlinear, weaving connections between and through text, commentary, and paratext.\n \u003e \n \u003e This is to say that these principles are not attached to a particular technology, although different technologies will have different affordances which shape how they can be put into practice, for better or worse.\n\n[üìñ](../Paper/Four%20principles%20of%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20methodology.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Presentation/Note-taking-as-an-interdisciplinary-feminist-method":{"title":"Note-taking as an interdisciplinary feminist method","content":"\n[McGill Feminist Research Colloquium](https://frcmcgill.blogspot.com/p/2023-schedule-and-abstracts.html), April 13, 2023  |   [Kit Chokly](https://kitchokly.com), PhD Student in Communication Studies\n\n![IMG_3345.jpg](../IMG_3345.jpg)\n*Two of the author‚Äôs milk crates stuffed full of notebooks, file folders, and envelopes.* \n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e Next: [Agenda  üëâ](Presentation%20Agenda.md)\n\n---\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!quote\\]- Transcript\n \u003e \n \u003e Hi everyone, my name is Kit and I‚Äôm a PhD student in Communication Studies here. Today I‚Äôm going to talk about something which has become a bit of a side interest for me over the past year or so, and that‚Äôs note-taking as a form of knowledge production.\n \u003e \n \u003e Throughout my time in graduate school, I‚Äôve had some issues with note-taking. I take notes to help me remember what I learn‚Ä¶ but I take so many notes that I kept forgetting about the fact¬†that I took a particular note in the first place. \n \u003e \n \u003e So my notes were generally looking like this‚Äîa seemingly-organized box of notebooks containing many notes that *could and did* relate to each other, but I was failing to actually make those connections. This meant I was doing a lot of repetitive work and missing entire bodies of knowledge in my research which I had actually already encountered before.\n \u003e \n \u003e This brought me into researching some of the histories and methodological principles of note-taking. And considering how much of what I‚Äôve found in these spaces emerge from academia‚Äôs history of colonialism and today‚Äôs always-on productivity culture, I wanted to see if I could take some of these principles while remaining oriented towards social justice.\n\nRead the paper [Developing a feminist note-taking system](../Paper/Developing%20a%20feminist%20note-taking%20system.md), or click the link with the üìñ icon at the bottom of each page to go directly to the paper‚Äôs relevant section, if there is one.\n\n[üìñ](../Paper/Introduction.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.33803552Z","tags":[]},"/Presentation/Note-taking-in-academic-literature":{"title":"The Issue (1/3)","content":"\n## Note-taking in academic literature\n\n* Considered a part of other methods\n* Understands notes as representational\n* Used to inform subsequent analysis\n\n# \n\n \u003e \n \u003e Next: [Feminist concerns with representation üëâ](Feminist%20concerns%20with%20representation.md)\n\n---\n\n \u003e \n \u003e \\[!quote\\]- Transcript\n \u003e \n \u003e Much writing on notes within academic work focuses on their role in other research methods, especially in concert with methods like ethnography or interviews.

Understanding note-taking as a feminist method asks that we think about what we consider note-worthy and how we represent our sources, even in our personal writing. It also asks that we think about how we come to bring these ideas into relation with others throughout our research process.\n \u003e \n \u003e Critically, a good note-taking system is informed by the person who uses it. Everyone works differently and has different research goals‚Äîthere is definitely no one-size-fits all for networked note-taking. If anything, though, I think this underlines the possibilities of note-taking as an interdisciplinary feminist method, one which I think can support a huge variety of research dedicated to producing more socially just knowledges.\n \u003e \n \u003e I hope these principles have helped you think about your own note-taking processes, something which I am also happy to hear more about, so please feel free to reach out to chat.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.362035815Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.362035815Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[notes/images/fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-12T22:44:37.366035864Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
